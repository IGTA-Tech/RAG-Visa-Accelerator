Hey Brett, how's it going? I was over here overthinking again and I was trying like I have several brands that we use to do our visa solutions, whether it be sports or just kind of professionals in general. when it comes to different ways of doing the agent-based filing for O-ones and P-ones, meaning it's not the employer that does the visa, but it's our talent agency that does the visa, not just for tech, but other kind of situations as well. And what I'm finding is that I've been trying to automate things that could just be done better with a person that can do it well. And so I just wanted to present this to you to see if there's an interest in there and just doing business development in general, because then we can get things going a lot better and then I can stop like kind of coding my way out of this and just really trust somebody to do it. And it's not much different from what you're doing with the talent side of things. It's just for different type of ventures. And so I'll kind of show you what I'm talking about. So here is a lead sheet that has Shared Sports Visas, Innovative Global Talent Agency, Aventis. These are all like the Innovative Automations website you're familiar with, but it's not about tech. It's more kind of in general. It's a different type of industry. But we have plenty of leads. And what I was trying to do was get it coded for automatic responses and follow ups for this. but it's just not effective and it's not getting right at the volume that we're doing it in. And I think I just need to blow it up and just go kind of old school. Because this morning you can see like kind of all these went out and it just didn't, it just didn't work like I wanted it to. And even sent messages to people I didn't want to send messages to. And it's just like, you know what, let's go back to the basics. Let's get a real person to follow up on these and see how it goes. and yeah i definitely sent messages to that we weren't supposed to send out and um so a little discouraged by that but i look at it as hey don't fight the world just simplify and keep it going so that way i was going to see if you're interested while the other development the innovative development um gas pipeline is growing to look at this. We have Aventis Visa Agents, which just does the petitioning. And this is for industries in general. It's not for just tech people or something like that. But it's for kind of like everybody. I'm gonna take a screenshot, because as you can see, there's a problem with this website. Let me hit up the developer. Let's see if we got the right screen. It's covering over the hero section. Okay, so that's innovative. Well, Adventist visa agents. This one is an innovative global talent agency. What we'll find is when somebody is looking for an agent for either event in general, they'll probably hit up both of these. But we have both of these brands and they just don't know it. So we can see that people are kind of shopping around a little bit. Shared sports visas is where we get our inquiries kind of nationally for people looking for sports related visas. And Pinto's partners are for people that are like entrepreneurs kind of well off for them to to get immigration work. But really what we need is help with business development on this from a person that will take it kind of like serious and keep things moving. It has intuition. They can see what kind of hot leads are and which aren't. And I think doing this, we can get the compensation like pretty good. And I can give up on doing a lot of this coding stuff because it's just not the same as somebody calling and making it happen. So let me know if you're interested in kind of doing this as a whole, business development as a whole when it comes to these brands. And it's all selling the same kind of thing. It's just the industry is different. But I hope you get this well. I tried to keep it short and talk to you tomorrow.
