Testimonials A trusted immigration solution for talent and companies Through The Build Fellowship we were able to retain exceptionally talented people that go above and beyond in their roles and are dedicated to the mission of our work. Lauren Abda Founder, Branchfood The Build Fellowship changed my life for the better! Not only did it do so in the most obvious way (set up an immigration pathway in the U.S.) but it also helped me discover my own leadership and management skills. ‍ Ketaki Adhikari Principal Research Associate, Foghorn Therapeutics The Build Fellowship has brought top talent from growing companies to inspire and educate our students. They have been instrumental in helping diverse learners build social capital and technical skills to land fulfilling roles at high-growth companies. ‍ Aisha Francis President, Franklin Tech The Build Fellowship has put together a superb program.

Highly recommend as the complete end-to-end solution for your H-1B needs. ‍ Mason Zheng Founder, Telgorithm Through The Build Fellowship we were able to retain exceptionally talented people that go above and beyond in their roles and are dedicated to the mission of our work. Jad Esber Founder, Koodos Labs The Build Fellowship has given us peace of mind. This opportunity allows us to retain our top talent and gives our employees a chance to practice their leadership and project management skills. Kendra Heard HR, Outrider.ai We&#x27;re grateful to have learned about The Build Fellowship, which has been key to hiring and retaining talent in scientific expertise sets. Build is an invaluable resource in the face of an otherwise frustrating and opaque process. Robert DiFazio CEO, Parallel Bio Every year the H-1B cap lottery gets worse and the odds are stacked against employers and their candidates who require an H-1B work visa. I am very glad to have found out about Open Avenues [Build Fellowship] and its unique model to facilitate concurrent H-1B opportunities— it is definitely worth checking out. Bob Webber Webber Arredondo Oja, LLC The Open Avenues Foundation has proven to be an invaluable partner for my practice. The Build Fellowship has ensured that my clients are able to retain key foreign talent while participants can continue to develop their practical skills in the United States. This is an essential solution to problems posed by an unpredictable immigration landscape. Alex Peters Peters Immigration Law P.C. Our clients appreciate working with Open Avenues! The program provides an alternative path for individuals to live and work in the U.S. when their employment here is urgent and important and if they aren&#x27;t qualified for an O-1 yet or can&#x27;t afford to wait for the H-1B lottery. It&#x27;s wonderful being able to offer our clients an alternate path. Not only are our clients&#x27; lives and companies changed, but it&#x27;s amazing to pay it forward and improve the quality of U.S. STEM education for our students! Sophie Alcorn Alcorn Immigration Law Shritesh is a foreign national from Nepal, and came to the United States in 2015 to pursue his masters. He had a penchant for two things: entrepreneurship and mentorship—two pursuits he wanted to continue in the United States, a place he saw limitless in opportunities. After getting selected for The Build Fellowship by Open Avenues, Shritesh created an industry-based project through his company, Remix Labs where he was assigned a Queens College student named Wilber. An aspiring software engineer with a passion for coding and gaming, Wilber brought a fresh, technical perspective to the no-code software platform Remix Labs operates on. His dedication, above-and-beyond approach and work ethic did not go unnoticed. Shritesh was so impressed by his work, that Wilber became the first junior-level, no-interview hire. Mentoring Wilber and witnessing his growth reinforced the gratifying experience of guiding future tech talents. <br><b>“The internship at Remix Labs was great for someone like me who wanted to get into programming in the tech space. During the internship, I got exposure to the Remix Labs platform and all of its functionalities. The platform itself is a no-code tool used to build out applications. I also learned how to design the flow of an app process data in a programming environment. Shritesh was such a smart and approachable project leader, and helped me every step of the way. He was my biggest advocate and got me a job as a Product Engineer position at the company—with no interview! He believed in me that much! Though I’m not working on his team, I still consider him my mentor. He’s the reason I was able to start my career.”</b><br> Shritesh Bhattarai Open Avenues Fellow, Software Engineer at Remix Labs Previous slide Next slide Resources Immigration resources and fellowship information Events and webinars Keep up with The Build Fellowship&#x27;s updates and activities.

H3: Talent transcends boundaries
H3: Global talent strengthens the U.S.

H3: We’re always looking for new talent",about,"About Us – The Build Fellowship Building pathways for global talent We believe when global talent builds in the United States, we all progress. Partner with us About The Build Fellowship story In 2014, The Build Fellowship’s Cofounder and Chief Immigration Officer, Jeff Goldman developed the legal infrastructure for what became the country’s first cap-exempt H-1B program, the Global Entrepreneur in Residence (GEIR) program. Jeff worked alongside USCIS and former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick to design a program that helped foreign national founders stay and build companies in Massachusetts, by working part-time for UMass Boston. Building on the success of that model, Jeff and Danielle - a father-daughter duo - came together in 2018 to solve the challenges of the adoption and implementation of the GEIR concept. Open Avenues Foundation became the first nonprofit affiliated with U.S. colleges and universities to offer part-time employment and cap-exempt H-1B sponsorship opportunities to foreign nationals willing to spend 5-hours per week leading students in skills-development programs. Over the last 5 years, Open Avenues Foundation has employed foreign founders and key talent from more than 150 companies within its Fellowship program, supporting 1000+ students from 12 colleges and universities around the United States. Now, The Build Fellowship is bringing this model to nonprofit partners across the country. $ 0 M contributed to the U.S. GDP by Build Fellows 0 % visa approval rate 0 + Student participants Values The Build philosophy Talent transcends boundaries Every person possesses the ability to achieve success, irrespective of their origin, background, or socio-economic status. Global talent strengthens the U.S. Foreign nationals are part and parcel to the United States’ rich social fabric, and robust economy. Varied cultural perspectives and incredible work ethic foster new ideas, which bloom into American businesses, creating more employment opportunities in the U.S. Creativity is a solution Creative thinking is the driver of effective and viable solutions. Build addresses entrenched challenges like immigration limitations, visa complications and talent scarcities through creativity and innovation. Impact In 2024, The Build Fellowship’s education programming is projected to serve over 500 individuals at 10 partner institutions with programming put on by 100 Fellows. Through The Build Fellowship, foreign nationals, in conjunction with nonprofit organizations, produce best-in-class research, publish industry content, lead 1-on-1 technical skills-building sessions, and offer industry guidance to college students and the public at-large in high-growth fields such as computer science, engineering, and biotechnology. In 2024, The Build Fellowship’s education programming is projected to serve over 500 individuals at 10 partner institutions with programming put on by 100 Fellows. This reflects a 600% growth in individuals served since 2020 along with more than a 300% increase in the number of partner institutions.

Get started + 0 Students participating 0 % of students are confident they will succeed in the STEM / Business industry 0 + FOREIGN NATIONALS PARTICIPATING Testimonials Student feedback Through this opportunity, I was able to picture myself as a data analyst. This was my first time using Tableau. Now, it has become one of the skills I can offer to the companies I will be applying for. By doing this project, I have a solid presentation that I can add to my portfolio. I have a full-time job. I am not a traditional STEM student, and my background is in social sciences. I find that many internship opportunities are geared towards traditional, younger students. I am so grateful that Open Avenues [Build Fellowship] has given me a chance to build technical experience despite my unconventional career trajectory. The project leader was super nice. Despite his busy schedule, he made time to give me feedback on my project and even offered to do a resume review. He also taught us to how to use parameters and calculated fields inside Tableau, which came in very handy in my presentation. His feedback to add the article findings to my presentation made my claim stronger. Finding stories and pattern from data was very interesting and I even thought that I may be very good at it. Read more Jasmine Kim Queens College Cuny, Stony Brook University My experience was an extremely rewarding experience. The Build Fellow helped me develop technical skills. The project introduced me to new concepts and forms of analyses I had never done before. We utilized the time to answer questions and meet project goals. I&#x27;m thankful for this experience, it was a really good time exploring a career path I hadn&#x27;t thought of before.

He had a penchant for two things: entrepreneurship and mentorship—two pursuits he wanted to continue in the United States, a place he saw limitless in opportunities. After getting selected for The Build Fellowship by Open Avenues, Shritesh created an industry-based project through his company, Remix Labs where he was assigned a Queens College student named Wilber. An aspiring software engineer with a passion for coding and gaming, Wilber brought a fresh, technical perspective to the no-code software platform Remix Labs operates on. His dedication, above-and-beyond approach and work ethic did not go unnoticed. Shritesh was so impressed by his work, that Wilber became the first junior-level, no-interview hire. Mentoring Wilber and witnessing his growth reinforced the gratifying experience of guiding future tech talents. “The internship at Remix Labs was great for someone like me who wanted to get into programming in the tech space. During the internship, I got exposure to the Remix Labs platform and all of its functionalities. The platform itself is a no-code tool used to build out applications. I also learned how to design the flow of an app process data in a programming environment. Shritesh was such a smart and approachable project leader, and helped me every step of the way. He was my biggest advocate and got me a job as a Product Engineer position at the company—with no interview! He believed in me that much! Though I’m not working on his team, I still consider him my mentor. He’s the reason I was able to start my career.” Wilber Queens College Graduate Product Engineer at Remix Lab","The Fellowship

They have been instrumental in helping diverse learners build social capital and technical skills to land fulfilling roles at high-growth companies. ‍ Aisha Francis President, Franklin Tech The Build Fellowship has put together a superb program.

Kendra Heard HR, Outrider.ai We&#x27;re grateful to have learned about The Build Fellowship, which has been key to hiring and retaining talent in scientific expertise sets. Build is an invaluable resource in the face of an otherwise frustrating and opaque process. Robert DiFazio CEO, Parallel Bio Every year the H-1B cap lottery gets worse and the odds are stacked against employers and their candidates who require an H-1B work visa. I am very glad to have found out about Open Avenues [Build Fellowship] and its unique model to facilitate concurrent H-1B opportunities— it is definitely worth checking out. Bob Webber Webber Arredondo Oja, LLC The Open Avenues Foundation has proven to be an invaluable partner for my practice. The Build Fellowship has ensured that my clients are able to retain key foreign talent while participants can continue to develop their practical skills in the United States. This is an essential solution to problems posed by an unpredictable immigration landscape. Alex Peters Peters Immigration Law P.C. Our clients appreciate working with Open Avenues! The program provides an alternative path for individuals to live and work in the U.S. when their employment here is urgent and important and if they aren&#x27;t qualified for an O-1 yet or can&#x27;t afford to wait for the H-1B lottery. It&#x27;s wonderful being able to offer our clients an alternate path. Not only are our clients&#x27; lives and companies changed, but it&#x27;s amazing to pay it forward and improve the quality of U.S. STEM education for our students! Sophie Alcorn Alcorn Immigration Law Shritesh is a foreign national from Nepal, and came to the United States in 2015 to pursue his masters. He had a penchant for two things: entrepreneurship and mentorship—two pursuits he wanted to continue in the United States, a place he saw limitless in opportunities. After getting selected for The Build Fellowship by Open Avenues, Shritesh created an industry-based project through his company, Remix Labs where he was assigned a Queens College student named Wilber. An aspiring software engineer with a passion for coding and gaming, Wilber brought a fresh, technical perspective to the no-code software platform Remix Labs operates on. His dedication, above-and-beyond approach and work ethic did not go unnoticed. Shritesh was so impressed by his work, that Wilber became the first junior-level, no-interview hire. Mentoring Wilber and witnessing his growth reinforced the gratifying experience of guiding future tech talents. <br><b>“The internship at Remix Labs was great for someone like me who wanted to get into programming in the tech space. During the internship, I got exposure to the Remix Labs platform and all of its functionalities. The platform itself is a no-code tool used to build out applications. I also learned how to design the flow of an app process data in a programming environment. Shritesh was such a smart and approachable project leader, and helped me every step of the way. He was my biggest advocate and got me a job as a Product Engineer position at the company—with no interview! He believed in me that much! Though I’m not working on his team, I still consider him my mentor. He’s the reason I was able to start my career.”</b><br> Shritesh Bhattarai Open Avenues Fellow, Software Engineer at Remix Labs Previous slide Next slide Resources Recommended resources Guide The Build Fellowship pricing model View Now Guide The Build Fellowship Overview View Now Brochure Become a Build Fellowship immigration law partner View Now Have a client you&#x27;d like to refer?

I also learned how to design the flow of an app process data in a programming environment. Shritesh was such a smart and approachable project leader, and helped me every step of the way. He was my biggest advocate and got me a job as a Product Engineer position at the company—with no interview! He believed in me that much! Though I’m not working on his team, I still consider him my mentor. He’s the reason I was able to start my career.”</b><br> Shritesh Bhattarai Open Avenues Fellow, Software Engineer at Remix Labs Previous slide Next slide Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Nominate a candidate Pricing Funding The Build Fellowship $4000 /month 12-month minimum commitment.

Testimonials A trusted immigration solution for talent and companies Through The Build Fellowship we were able to retain exceptionally talented people that go above and beyond in their roles and are dedicated to the mission of our work. Lauren Abda Founder, Branchfood The Build Fellowship changed my life for the better! Not only did it do so in the most obvious way (set up an immigration pathway in the U.S.) but it also helped me discover my own leadership and management skills. ‍ Ketaki Adhikari Principal Research Associate, Foghorn Therapeutics The Build Fellowship has brought top talent from growing companies to inspire and educate our students. They have been instrumental in helping diverse learners build social capital and technical skills to land fulfilling roles at high-growth companies. ‍ Aisha Francis President, Franklin Tech The Build Fellowship has put together a superb program. We were able to get our employee from overseas and shepherd his H-1B capped process. Highly recommend as the complete end-to-end solution for your H-1B needs. ‍ Mason Zheng Founder, Telgorithm Through The Build Fellowship we were able to retain exceptionally talented people that go above and beyond in their roles and are dedicated to the mission of our work. Jad Esber Founder, Koodos Labs The Build Fellowship has given us peace of mind. This opportunity allows us to retain our top talent and gives our employees a chance to practice their leadership and project management skills. Kendra Heard HR, Outrider.ai We&#x27;re grateful to have learned about The Build Fellowship, which has been key to hiring and retaining talent in scientific expertise sets. Build is an invaluable resource in the face of an otherwise frustrating and opaque process. Robert DiFazio CEO, Parallel Bio Every year the H-1B cap lottery gets worse and the odds are stacked against employers and their candidates who require an H-1B work visa. I am very glad to have found out about Open Avenues [Build Fellowship] and its unique model to facilitate concurrent H-1B opportunities— it is definitely worth checking out. Bob Webber Webber Arredondo Oja, LLC The Open Avenues Foundation has proven to be an invaluable partner for my practice. The Build Fellowship has ensured that my clients are able to retain key foreign talent while participants can continue to develop their practical skills in the United States. This is an essential solution to problems posed by an unpredictable immigration landscape. Alex Peters Peters Immigration Law P.C. Our clients appreciate working with Open Avenues! The program provides an alternative path for individuals to live and work in the U.S. when their employment here is urgent and important and if they aren&#x27;t qualified for an O-1 yet or can&#x27;t afford to wait for the H-1B lottery. It&#x27;s wonderful being able to offer our clients an alternate path. Not only are our clients&#x27; lives and companies changed, but it&#x27;s amazing to pay it forward and improve the quality of U.S. STEM education for our students! Sophie Alcorn Alcorn Immigration Law Shritesh is a foreign national from Nepal, and came to the United States in 2015 to pursue his masters. He had a penchant for two things: entrepreneurship and mentorship—two pursuits he wanted to continue in the United States, a place he saw limitless in opportunities. After getting selected for The Build Fellowship by Open Avenues, Shritesh created an industry-based project through his company, Remix Labs where he was assigned a Queens College student named Wilber. An aspiring software engineer with a passion for coding and gaming, Wilber brought a fresh, technical perspective to the no-code software platform Remix Labs operates on. His dedication, above-and-beyond approach and work ethic did not go unnoticed. Shritesh was so impressed by his work, that Wilber became the first junior-level, no-interview hire. Mentoring Wilber and witnessing his growth reinforced the gratifying experience of guiding future tech talents. <br><b>“The internship at Remix Labs was great for someone like me who wanted to get into programming in the tech space. During the internship, I got exposure to the Remix Labs platform and all of its functionalities. The platform itself is a no-code tool used to build out applications. I also learned how to design the flow of an app process data in a programming environment. Shritesh was such a smart and approachable project leader, and helped me every step of the way. He was my biggest advocate and got me a job as a Product Engineer position at the company—with no interview! He believed in me that much! Though I’m not working on his team, I still consider him my mentor. He’s the reason I was able to start my career.”</b><br> Shritesh Bhattarai Open Avenues Fellow, Software Engineer at Remix Labs Previous slide Next slide Resources Immigration resources and fellowship information Events and webinars Keep up with The Build Fellowship&#x27;s updates and activities.

H2: Employee benefactor sample email 2",content page,"Employee benefactor sample emails All Guide and Brochures Employee benefactor sample emails Employee benefactor sample email 1 Dear EMPLOYER NAME, I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out about a potential solution to my work visa situation. The Build Fellowship is an organization whose mission is to provide career pathways for everyone, no matter where they are from. They offer a cap-exempt H-1B visa solution for foreign nationals looking to work full-time in the U.S. I would work part-time for approximately 5 hours per week with a nonprofit through The Build Fellowship while also working full-time with COMPANY NAME. During my part-time work as a Build Fellow, I'd work directly with U.S. college and universities to advance the United States education system. The onboarding of new Fellows takes about 6-8 weeks, enabling cap subject companies, such as COMPANY NAME, to file a concurrent H-1B petition for my full-time employment. Companies are responsible for the financial commitment of the Fellowship program. I am attaching the Pricing information from Build. Although I am aware of the significant commitment that comes with this Fellowship, I believe it is the most sustainable solution to my work visa situation. It allows me to work 3 years with the ability to renew for an additional 3 years at COMPANY NAME. Additionally, the skills and experience I will gain from training students and networking with potential candidates for our company will benefit the future of COMPANY NAME as well. If you would like to learn more about The Build Fellowship visit their website here . You can also schedule an initial consultation with The Build Fellowship team here . Let me know if you have any questions. I appreciate your consideration. Best, YOUR NAME Employee benefactor sample email 2 Dear EMPLOYER NAME, I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to share a promising solution to my work visa situation that offers an alternative to the H-1B lottery, with a 99%+ approval rate. This solution is a cap-exempt H-1B visa, sponsored by The Build Fellowship, that would allow me to continue working full-time at COMPANY NAME. The Build Fellowship is an organization whose mission is to provide career pathways for everyone, no matter where they are from. They offer a cap-exempt H-1B visa for foreign nationals seeking full-time employment in the U.S. like me. This solution allows me to work full time for COMPANY NAME, while working ~5 hours a week on a part-time basis with The Build Fellowship as a Global Talent Fellow. Highlights of The Build Fellowship: Talent Retention: Attract, hire, and retain the world&#x27;s top talent to work in the U.S Certainty: 99% approval rate for eligible foreign nationals accepted into The Build Fellowship Speed: ~8-10 weeks total duration, from process start until concurrent H-1B is approved Timing: Employee can start working full-time immediately once concurrent H-1B is received by USCIS To join the Fellowship, you, as the employer, would need to nominate me for this opportunity. The Build Fellowship offers a free initial consultation to assess the probability of a successful approval before entering any contract. See this info session from the founder and CEO, Danielle Goldman, for a detailed overview, including benefits, next steps, and costs. Although I am aware of the significant commitment that comes with this Fellowship, it would allow me to continue to work at COMPANY NAME for 3 years with the ability to renew for an additional 3 years. The skills and experience I will gain from training students and networking with potential candidates will benefit the future of COMPANY NAME as well.

This was my first time using Tableau. Now, it has become one of the skills I can offer to the companies I will be applying for. By doing this project, I have a solid presentation that I can add to my portfolio. I have a full-time job. I am not a traditional STEM student, and my background is in social sciences. I find that many internship opportunities are geared towards traditional, younger students. I am so grateful that Open Avenues [Build Fellowship] has given me a chance to build technical experience despite my unconventional career trajectory. The project leader was super nice. Despite his busy schedule, he made time to give me feedback on my project and even offered to do a resume review. He also taught us to how to use parameters and calculated fields inside Tableau, which came in very handy in my presentation. His feedback to add the article findings to my presentation made my claim stronger. Finding stories and pattern from data was very interesting and I even thought that I may be very good at it.","The Fellowship

If you are a foreign national who wants to work or continue working in the U.S., securing your visa is a top priority — The Build Fellowship is here to help. Funding The Fellowship You will need a benefactor to finance your Fellowship, as a Fellow cannot pay for their own Fellowship. There are two primary types of benefactors: U.S. Employers and companies willing to sponsor a candidate&#x27;s Fellowship Individuals willing to fund a candidate&#x27;s Fellowship through a legal entity (like an LLC they form) Pricing Model $4000 per month Includes program fees and sponsorship for part-time cap-exempt H-1B visa Includes 5 hours per week of salary at the fair prevailing wage FAQs Who is a benefactor? An organization that has an interest supporting a Fellow’s career development in the U.S. Can be any type of organization - nonprofit, LLC, corporation, etc. - inside or outside of the U.S. Benefactor organizations can have a relationship with the Fellow (employee, desired employee, owned by a relative, friend, or even be owned by the Fellow themselves) Benefactors do not need to commit to employing the Fellow, but they must commit to paying the Fellowship fees How do benefactors fund the Fellowship? Benefactor commits to paying the monthly program fee Benefactor payments cannot be from a personal bank account, must be from the business account Proof of funds must be sent to The Build Fellowship (bank statement, etc) demonstrating access to $250,000 funds or provide payment up front for 6 months of fees What do benefactors agree to? Benefactors must sign the Benefactor Agreement with The Build Fellowship The Fellowship and cap-exempt H-1B will only last as long as there is an active Benefactor agreement The Fellow can change Benefactors as long as a new organization signs a Benefactor Agreement The Fellow can have a concurrent employer who is not the benefactor as long as the benefactor agreement remains in place and the benefactor signs off on the concurrent employer How do I talk to a benefactor about funding my Fellowship? Securing a U.S. work visa is difficult, even for highly skilled foreign nationals who qualify for the H-1B visa are rarely accepted due to a randomized lottery. Last year – only 24% of applicants were selected. The Build Fellowship is a program that will allow you to live and work in the U.S. by securing a cap-exempt H-1B visa. Fellows work 5 hours a week for The Build Fellowship’s nonprofit partners training students and advancing the U.S. education system. Once a foreign national's Build Fellowship starts, they are then eligible to work full time for a U.S. company. This makes hiring the foreign national more appealing. The Fellowship lasts a minimum of twelve months and up to three years. An additional three year extension is possible. Download the brochure Request more information Looking for more?

International student departments work with The Build Fellowship to educate students about this option post-graduation. For international students finishing Optional Practical Training (OPT) post-graduation, the H-1B work visa is the most common next step to work in the U.S. The annual H-1B lottery selects 85,000 registrants at random, often restricting promising founders and highly-skilled talent. Congress deemed four types of organizations exempt, or cap-exempt, from the annual H-1B lottery system: Nonprofit research institutions Government research institutions Universities Nonprofit organizations affiliated with universities Build Fellows are offered part-time employment at nonprofit organizations affiliated with universities and are in-turn sponsored for cap-exempt H-1B visas. While in part-time employment with a cap-exempt nonprofit, any U.S. employer can then file a concurrent cap-exempt H-1B for a Build Fellow, enabling them to stay and work in the United States.

If you are a foreign national who wants to work or continue working in the U.S., securing your visa is a top priority — The Build Fellowship is here to help. Offers an immigration solution for global talent Advances the missions of U.S. colleges, universities, & research institutions Prepares college students across the U.S. for jobs in high-demand fields Fills talent gaps for U.S. companies and increases the competitiveness of the economy at large You will need a benefactor to finance your Fellowship. A Fellow cannot pay for their own Fellowship. There are two primary types of benefactors: U.S. Employers and companies willing to sponsor a candidate’s fellowship Individual benefactors willing to fund a candidate’s fellowship How do I talk to my employer about funding my Fellowship? KEY POINTS TO KEEP IN MIND Sponsorship benefits you, your employer, and the U.S. workforce at large. U.S. companies in the fastest growing industries need access to specialized talent to maintain a competitive edge. Hiring highly-skilled foreign nationals to work full-time at U.S. companies often requires the foreign national to obtain an H-1B visa, however, the annual cap on H-1B visas is a significant barrier. The Build Fellowship’s cap-exempt H-1B visa solution offers an immigration pathway for skilled foreign talent to work full-time in the U.S. without relying on the H-1B lottery. Once Build Fellows are approved for a cap-exempt H-1B and begin the Fellowship, their full-time employer can immediately file a concurrent H-1B outside of the lottery. How your company will benefit Attract top talent Attract the world’s top talent for full-time U.S. employment opportunities through partnering with The Build Fellowship. Retain top talent Retain your current talent by offering visa sponsorship. Build talent pipelines Gain unique access to students trained with relevant industry knowledge entering the workforce Gain employee loyalty Sponsoring builds loyalty and deepens the employee employer relationship. An employee with a work visa sponsored through a company for a specified time is much less likely to leave than another employee who has less incentive to stick around. Promote diversity Hiring employees from other countries enables a company to bring together different perspectives and experiences, promoting diversity within the company. Diverse teams deliver 60% better results and make better decisions in 87% of cases. Find peace of mind Have a back-up plan to the H-1B lottery, so you can forecast your needs accordingly. Employee benefactor sample email 1 Dear EMPLOYER NAME, I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out about a potential solution to my work visa situation. The Build Fellowship is an organization whose mission is to provide career pathways for everyone, no matter where they are from. They offer a cap-exempt H-1B visa solution for foreign nationals looking to work full-time in the U.S. I would work part-time for approximately 5 hours per week with a nonprofit through The Build Fellowship while also working full-time with COMPANY NAME. During my part-time work as a Build Fellow, I’d work directly with U.S. college and universities to advance the United States education system. The onboarding of new Fellows takes about 6-8 weeks, enabling cap subject companies, such as COMPANY NAME, to file a concurrent H-1B petition for my full-time employment. Companies are responsible for the financial commitment of the Fellowship program. I am attaching the Pricing information from Build. Although I am aware of the significant commitment that comes with this Fellowship, I believe it is the most sustainable solution to my work visa situation. It allows me to work 3 years with the ability to renew for an additional 3 years at COMPANY NAME. Additionally, the skills and experience I will gain from training students and networking with potential candidates for our company will benefit the future of COMPANY NAME as well. If you would like to learn more about The Build Fellowship visit their website here . You can also schedule an initial consultation with The Build Fellowship team here .

KEY POINTS TO KEEP IN MIND Securing a U.S. work visa is difficult, even for highly skilled foreign nationals who studied areas in STEM and business who qualify for the H-1B visa are rarely accepted due to a randomized lottery. Last year – only 24% of applicants were selected. The Build Fellowship is a program that will allow me to live and work in the U.S. through securing a cap-exempt H-1B visa. Fellows work ~5 hours a week for The Build Fellowship’s nonprofit partners advancing the U.S. education system training students. Once a foreign national’s Build Fellowship starts, they are then eligible to work full-time for a U.S. company, making hiring the foreign national more appealing. The Fellowship lasts a minimum of twelve months and up to three years. An additional three year extension is possible.

Key points to keep in mind Securing a U.S. work visa is difficult, even for highly skilled foreign nationals who studied areas in STEM and business who qualify for the H-1B visa are rarely accepted due to a randomized lottery. Last year – only 24% of applicants were selected. The Build Fellowship is a program that will allow me to live and work in the U.S. through securing a cap-exempt H-1B visa. Fellows work ~5 hours a week for The Build Fellowship's nonprofit partners advancing the U.S. education system training students. Once a foreign national's Build Fellowship starts, they are then eligible to work full-time for a U.S. company, making hiring the foreign national more appealing. The Fellowship lasts a minimum of twelve months and up to three years. An additional three year extension is possible. Download the brochure Request more information Looking for more?

Key points to keep in mind Sponsorship benefits you, your employer, and the U.S. workforce at large. U.S. companies in the fastest growing industries need access to specialized talent to maintain a competitive edge. Hiring highly-skilled foreign nationals to work full-time at U.S. companies often requires the foreign national to obtain an H-1B visa, however, the annual cap on H-1B visas is a significant barrier. The Build Fellowship's cap-exempt H-1B visa solution offers an immigration pathway for skilled foreign talent to work full-time in the U.S. without relying on the H-1B lottery. Once Build Fellows are approved for a cap-exempt H-1B and begin the Fellowship, their full-time employer can immediately file a concurrent H-1B outside of the lottery. How your company will benefit Attract top talent Attract the world's top talent for full-time U.S. employment opportunities through partnering with The Build Fellowship. Retain top talent Retain your current talent by offering visa sponsorship. Build talent pipelines Gain unique access to students trained with relevant industry knowledge entering the workforce. Gain employee loyalty Sponsoring builds loyalty and deepens the employee employer relationship. An employee with a work visa sponsored through a company for a specified time is much less likely to leave than another employee who has less incentive to stick around. Promote diversity Hiring employees from other countries enables a company to bring together different perspectives and experiences, promoting diversity within the company. Diverse teams deliver 60% better results and make better decisions in 87% of cases [1] . Find peace of mind Have a back-up plan to the H-1B lottery, so you can forecast your needs accordingly.

All resources How does this enable companies to sponsor a cap-exempt H-1B for talent? Once an individual is approved and working for a cap-exempt organization, a new cap-subject employer can file a petition for concurrent H-1B employment at any time and does not have to go through the H-1B lottery process. The employee can start working for the new H-1B cap-subject employer upon the receipt of the H-1B petition. This is called H-1B portability. As soon as Build Fellows are approved for a cap-exempt H-1B and start their fellowship, their full-time employer (typically subject to the annual lottery) can immediately file an H-1B for them concurrently.

Can You Get More Than One RFE? Conclusion: RFE Readiness Is Key in 2025 Share: If you’re a foreign national or employer navigating the U.S. immigration process, you’ve likely heard of the term RFE , short for Request for Evidence . In 2025, RFEs are more than just a minor inconvenience — they’ve become a major checkpoint in the immigration journey , particularly for employment-based visas like the H-1B. What is an RFE? An RFE (Request for Evidence) is a formal request from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) asking for additional documents or clarification before they can approve or deny an immigration petition. It’s important to stress: An RFE is not a denial. It simply means USCIS needs more proof to make a decision. However, if handled poorly — or ignored — it could easily lead to a denial. RFE Rates Are Climbing — Here’s What We Are Experiencing On The Ground. At The Build Fellowship , our immigration team actively tracks the petitions we help support, and we are already seeing a sharp increase in RFE rates in 2025 (as of March 5, 2025) - increasing 23 percentage points since 2024. This sharp increase aligns with broader political trends. Immigration attorneys and employers are reporting heightened scrutiny from USCIS, particularly around specialty occupation classifications , employer-employee relationships , and degree qualifications for foreign nationals. How Trump’s 2025 Re-Election is Driving RFE Increases One of the clearest drivers behind the spike in RFEs in 2025 is the re-election of Donald Trump . Based on Trump’s immigration stance during his first term (2017-2021) and early executive actions since returning to office in January 2025, immigration policy has once again shifted toward increased enforcement and heightened scrutiny — especially in employment-based immigration. How Presidential Power Shapes RFEs The President doesn’t directly issue RFEs , but the executive branch oversees USCIS , which is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The President appoints the DHS Secretary and the USCIS Director , both of whom have enormous discretion over: Setting adjudication standards for visa petitions. Issuing policy memoranda that influence how officers evaluate cases. Creating internal training materials that guide RFE triggers. Prioritizing worksite enforcement , which indirectly influences how strictly petitions are reviewed. Trump’s Record and What It Means for 2025 RFEs During Trump’s first term, RFEs skyrocketed, especially for H-1B petitions. This was no accident — his administration issued policy memos encouraging USCIS officers to: Apply stricter standards to specialty occupation determinations . Heavily scrutinize third-party placements (common in IT consulting). Question the validity of degree equivalency evaluations from certain providers. Make it easier for officers to issue RFEs instead of approvals when they had any doubt about eligibility. Here’s some data we put together to demonstrate the disparity in historical rates of RFEs between the Trump administration vs the Biden administration on RFEs. As shown in the chart, the average RFE rate under the Trump administration (2017-2020) was on average 20-40 percentage points higher than the Biden administration (2021-2024). There is also significant seasonal patterns to RFE Rates under the Trump administration, with the lowest RFE rates in May which climbs steadily, peaking in Q4 (October-December): With Trump back in office in 2025, immigration attorneys are already reporting a return to these stricter adjudication patterns . Combined with Trump’s public statements promising to reduce work visa approvals and prioritize American workers, the surge in RFEs we’re seeing at The Build Fellowship isn’t surprising — and is likely to intensify throughout 2025 and beyond. Why Do Applicants Receive RFEs? USCIS issues RFEs for a variety of reasons, but most boil down to one thing: the initial petition didn’t provide enough clear, convincing evidence to satisfy eligibility requirements. Common Triggers for RFEs What Does an RFE Look Like? Explanation of the Issue: USCIS explains exactly what they believe is missing or unclear in your original filing. Specific Evidence Requested: This might include degrees, work samples, letters of support, financial documents, or legal clarifications. Response Deadline: Usually, applicants get 87 days to respond, but the timeframe can vary. Step-by-Step Guide to Responding to an RFE Here’s how to approach an RFE strategically to give yourself the best chance of approval: 1. Read It Thoroughly — and Break It Down Go through the RFE line by line. Highlight key requests and create a checklist so nothing gets missed. 2. Gather Documents (and Extra Evidence) Don’t just send the bare minimum. The goal is to overwhelm USCIS with clarity — think of it like answering every possible follow-up question before they even have to ask. 3. Organize Your Response Use a clear, labeled format with a cover letter explaining how each document addresses the specific issue raised in the RFE. 4. Consult with an Immigration Attorney This is especially important if the RFE raises legal or technical questions. If you need a trusted lawyer, our vetted network of immigration attorneys can connect you with experienced experts who understand employment-based immigration inside and out. 5. Respond Early Never wait until the last minute. USCIS must receive the full response before the deadline — not just a postmark date. Tips for Avoiding RFEs Table Special Considerations for H-1B Applicants H-1B petitions, especially for tech roles, are a prime target for RFEs . This is largely because: USCIS frequently questions whether the job truly qualifies as a specialty occupation . Roles that are generic-sounding (like ""analyst"" or ""consultant"") are more likely to trigger RFEs. If the employee works offsite (such as at a client site), USCIS may demand proof of employer control over daily tasks. What Happens if You Ignore an RFE? This part is critical: Ignoring an RFE almost always leads to denial. Even if the request seems unfair or unnecessary, you need to respond thoroughly and on time. If you miss the deadline, USCIS will treat the petition as abandoned and deny it outright. Can You Get More Than One RFE? Yes, especially in complex cases . After responding to the first RFE, USCIS can issue a second RFE if new questions arise. This is more common in cases involving: Complex employer-employee arrangements (like staffing agencies). Questions about degree equivalency for specialized roles. Concerns about maintenance of status when switching between visa types. Conclusion: RFE Readiness Is Key in 2025 RFEs are no longer the exception — they’re becoming the norm under the Trump Administration . With a higher rate of petitions triggering RFEs in 2025 , thorough preparation and proactive documentation is essential to keeping your immigration journey on track. Lastly, if the H-1B lottery didn’t go your way — you can obtain a cap-exempt H-1B as a Build Fellow . We’ve helped countless foreign nationals stay employed , navigate RFEs smoothly without relying on the lottery altogether by working with cap-exempt universities. You can also check out our fellows' success stories to see how this unique program has transformed real careers.

Change in Work Location: Change in Job Duties or Promotion: Salary and Working Conditions: Corporate Restructuring: How to File an H-1B Amendment File a New Labor Condition Application (LCA): Key Considerations for Employers and Employees Frequently Asked Questions About H-1B Amendments Maintain Compliance with The Build Fellowship Conclusion Share: A Complete Guide to the H-1B Amendment Process: When and How to File The H-1B visa program is highly regulated, with specific rules on maintaining employment terms that align with the original visa petition. When significant changes, known as ""material changes,"" occur in an H-1B employee's job, such as relocation, a shift in responsibilities, or a promotion, an amendment may be required to ensure compliance with U.S. immigration law. This guide will explore the scenarios where an H-1B amendment is necessary, how to file one, and why timely updates are critical for maintaining lawful status. What Triggers an H-1B Amendment? H-1B amendments must be filed for material changes in an H-1B holder's job. This includes: Change in Work Location: If an H-1B worker relocates to a worksite outside the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) specified in the original Labor Condition Application (LCA), an amendment is required. For example, moving from New York City to San Francisco would require an amendment since wages, working conditions, and compliance factors vary significantly across regions. Short-term placements (up to 30 days, or 60 days in some cases) outside the MSA may be exempt, but documentation must still align with USCIS standards for compliance​. Change in Job Duties or Promotion: If the core job responsibilities shift substantially—such as a software engineer promoted to a managerial role—an amendment is necessary. The new role must still qualify as a ""specialty occupation"" under H-1B requirements, and updated qualifications must be documented​. Salary and Working Conditions: Substantial salary increases, reduced hours, or modified job conditions that alter the original employment terms also require an amendment. This is crucial for maintaining wage compliance as stipulated in the LCA​. Corporate Restructuring: When an employer undergoes major corporate changes like mergers or acquisitions, an amendment may be necessary to inform USCIS of the updated employer details, ensuring that employment remains compliant with H-1B terms​. How to File an H-1B Amendment File a New Labor Condition Application (LCA): File a New Labor Condition Application (LCA): The employer must submit an updated LCA with the Department of Labor (DOL) for the new location or job role. The LCA ensures that wages and conditions meet regional requirements. Submit Form I-129: After the LCA is certified, the employer files an amended Form I-129, including the new LCA and any supporting documentation. This form is critical for notifying USCIS of the material changes and aligning the H-1B worker’s status with updated employment details. Premium Processing Option: If expedited processing is desired, employers can file Form I-907 alongside I-129 for premium processing, reducing USCIS review times from months to around 15 days, which is especially useful for time-sensitive relocations​. Key Considerations for Employers and Employees Timing and Compliance: Ideally, the amendment should be filed before the employee begins working under the new terms or at the new location. If immediate relocation is necessary, filing the amendment as promptly as possible is advisable to maintain compliance and avoid penalties​. Consequences of Not Filing: Failing to file an amendment for material changes can result in severe repercussions, including loss of H-1B status for the employee and potential fines or restrictions for the employer. USCIS may conduct site visits to verify compliance with filed amendments. Impact of Amendment Denial: If an amendment is denied, the employee can continue to work under the terms of the original petition, provided the location or duties revert to the original state. Employers should consult with immigration counsel to determine the best course of action following a denial​. Frequently Asked Questions About H-1B Amendments Maintain Compliance with The Build Fellowship At The Build Fellowship, we offer cap-exempt H-1B solutions designed to assist foreign national employees with an alternative pathway to maintain their work status in the U.S., without relying on the H-1B lottery. Our fellowship program is a concurrent, cap-exempt employment solution in partnership with universities, enabling international professionals to maintain their H-1B status without dependence on the H-1B cap. With the Build Fellowship program, foreign nationals have the opportunity to lead industry projects for five hours per week, which allows their main employer to file a concurrent, cap-exempt H-1B petition. This can be a strategic solution for professionals facing frequent relocations or changes in job duties that typically trigger H-1B amendments. To explore if our program is the right fit for you, learn more about the fellowship on our program page . Conclusion Filing an H-1B amendment is essential whenever there are material changes in employment, such as job location or role. Ensuring compliance with USCIS regulations can safeguard both employees and employers from penalties and potential status issues. By understanding the amendment process and maintaining accurate records, employers can keep their workforce legally compliant, and H-1B employees can stay focused on their professional growth in the U.S. An immigration pathway to train the future U.S. workforce The Build Fellowship offers a powerful solution for foreign nationals who were not selected in the H-1B lottery, but want to continue working in the U.S. Through our partnerships with nonprofits and universities, we enable fellows to work in part-time cap-exempt H-1B roles while retaining their primary employment.

This visa requires both meticulous planning and adherence to strict timelines, as applications must be submitted within defined windows and are subject to a lottery system due to high demand. USCIS has announced the lottery dates for 2025-2026, and we’ve broken this down in the article. Here’s a breakdown of each phase in the H-1B visa process, important dates, and a look at alternative options available for those who don’t secure an H-1B visa through the standard cap. Overview of the H-1B Visa Process Timeline Step 1: Employer Preparation (October – December) This early phase is critical for employers to prepare and finalize details to ensure that they can submit a compliant H-1B registration and petition. Candidate Identification: Employers assess workforce needs and identify potential H-1B candidates. This includes reviewing each candidate's qualifications to ensure they meet the requirements for specialty occupation status. Specialty Occupation Determination: Employers should confirm that the job position qualifies as a 'specialty occupation,' a term that USCIS defines as a role typically requiring a bachelor's degree or higher in a specific field. Document Collection: Employers gather necessary documentation, including the candidate's educational credentials, prior work experience, certifications, and any other materials that demonstrate their suitability for the role. Collecting and verifying these documents in advance prevents delays later. Budgeting and Planning: Employers should budget for potential H-1B application fees and consider whether they may want to use premium processing later in the application. Step 2: H-1B Registration Period (March) The H-1B registration period is a mandatory step and is conducted entirely online. USCIS Online Registration: During this phase, employers submit basic information about the company and the employee they wish to sponsor. For the 2025-26 season, the registration window was open from March 7 to March 24, 2025. Each employer account can submit multiple applications if sponsoring multiple employees. Confirmation and Submission: Once registration is submitted, USCIS will issue a confirmation for each candidate, which the employer should save for future reference. Step 3: H-1B Lottery Selection (March – April) If the number of registrations exceeds the annual cap, USCIS conducts a random selection process or “lottery” to determine which candidates will proceed to the next phase. Annual H-1B Cap: The standard H-1B cap is 65,000 visas, with an additional 20,000 visas for applicants holding advanced degrees from U.S. institutions. Lottery and Selection Notification: After the registration window closes, USCIS typically conducts the lottery in late March. Employers will receive notifications through their online account if their candidates have been selected by early April. Next Steps for Selected Candidates: Employers of selected candidates can begin preparing to file a complete H-1B petition (Form I-129) with supporting documents. For historical lottery selection results and insights, check out our article here . Step 4: Petition Filing Period (April – June) This is the phase where selected H-1B candidates officially submit their petitions to USCIS, with the goal of demonstrating that both the employer and the employee meet H-1B requirements. Labor Condition Application (LCA): Employers must file a Labor Condition Application (LCA) with the Department of Labor (DOL). The LCA outlines salary and working conditions to ensure the H-1B employee will be compensated fairly. The DOL typically takes about seven days to process the LCA, so it's best to file early. Form I-129 Submission: Once the LCA is certified, employers can submit Form I-129 (Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker) to USCIS, along with the certified LCA, documentation of the employee's qualifications, and proof that the role qualifies as a specialty occupation. USCIS usually provides a filing window of 90 days from April 1. Fees and Optional Premium Processing: Filing fees vary, and employers can choose to use premium processing, which costs an additional $2,500. With premium processing, USCIS will review the petition within 15 calendar days. Step 5: USCIS Processing (June – September) Once the H-1B petition is filed, it moves into USCIS processing, where officers review the submission and make a decision. Standard Processing: Regular processing can take several months, depending on USCIS's workload. During this time, USCIS may issue Requests for Evidence (RFEs) if more documentation or clarification is needed. Premium Processing (Optional): Employers who paid for premium processing will receive a decision within 15 calendar days. This can be helpful if the employer and candidate need to know the outcome sooner, though it does not affect the ultimate start date of October 1. Approval or Denial Notification: USCIS will notify the employer of approval or denial. Approved candidates receive an I-797 Notice of Action, which is necessary for employment authorization. Step 5: USCIS Processing (June – September) If the petition is approved, the candidate can begin working in their H-1B role as of October 1, the start of the fiscal year. Employment Authorization: The I-797 Notice of Action allows the employee to begin work in the United States legally under the H-1B visa status. Travel and Visa Stamping (If Abroad): For H-1B employees currently residing outside the U.S., the final step is to schedule a visa interview at a U.S. consulate. Once the visa is stamped, they can enter the U.S. and begin employment. Alternative Timeline and Pathways for Skilled Foreign Workers through Cap-Exempt H-1B Visas: The regular H-1B visa timeline is restricted by specific application windows and subject to annual caps, which often leave highly qualified foreign nationals without a visa due to the lottery system. However, there is a different category of H-1B visas known as cap-exempt H-1Bs , which allow for applications to be submitted year-round, irrespective of the annual cap. Here’s a closer look at how cap-exempt H-1Bs work and how they offer a flexible alternative for foreign nationals and employers. Key Differences of Cap-Exempt H-1B Visas Year-Round Application: Unlike the regular H-1B, which can only be filed in the designated period in March, cap-exempt H-1B petitions can be filed at any time throughout the year. This flexibility allows both foreign nationals and their employers to pursue visa sponsorship outside of the restrictive annual timelines. No Lottery Process: Cap-exempt H-1Bs are not subject to the annual 85,000 visa cap (65,000 for general applicants and 20,000 for U.S. advanced degree holders). As a result, there's no lottery process, reducing the uncertainty and enabling qualified foreign nationals to secure a visa without having to rely on chance. Eligibility Requirements: Cap-exempt H-1B visas are generally limited to specific types of employers, including: Institutions of higher education (universities and colleges) Non-profit organizations affiliated with universities Non-profit research organizations Government research organizations How The Build Fellowship Leverages Cap-Exempt H-1Bs for Foreign Nationals For foreign nationals who were not selected in the H-1B lottery or need to obtain an H-1B outside of the typical application windows, The Build Fellowship offers an innovative solution . By partnering with cap-exempt universities, The Build Fellowship enables fellows to work part-time leading students, allowing them to qualify for a cap-exempt H-1B. Here’s how this process works and how it benefits both fellows and their employers: Cap-Exempt Sponsorship through University Partnerships: The Build Fellowship works with H-1B cap-exempt universities, which means foreign nationals who join as fellows are eligible for a cap-exempt H-1B leading students on specialized industry projects. Concurrent Employment with Full-Time Employers: Once a Build Fellow obtains the part-time cap-exempt H-1B, their primary employer can file a full-time concurrent H-1B without going through the lottery — meaning the fellow can work full-time at a private company under the cap-exempt visa, without needing to wait for the next lottery. Ideal for High-Demand Situations and Flexible Hiring: Cap-exempt H-1Bs provide immediate hiring flexibility, which is crucial for companies with pressing project deadlines or hard-to-fill roles. Since The Build Fellowship operates outside the annual H-1B timeline, companies that need to bring in foreign talent on short notice, or whose candidates were not selected in the lottery, can still secure skilled employees through this alternative path. Long-Term Stability for Foreign Nationals: For foreign nationals, The Build Fellowship provides a pathway to sustained employment without the uncertainty of the lottery. Fellows gain the added benefit of contributing to higher education through leading industry projects while advancing their professional careers in the U.S. By using The Build Fellowship’s cap-exempt model, both employers and foreign national employees gain increased control over the H-1B process, reducing the risks and timelines associated with the traditional cap. If you’re interested in learning more about how The Build Fellowship has helped foreign nationals continue their employment without lottery dependence, check out our success stories from fellows or explore ongoing projects with cap-exempt university partners. Summary The H-1B visa process follows strict timelines and annual caps, often leaving many skilled foreign nationals without a visa due to the lottery system. This guide covered each stage, from preparation through petition filing, plus cap-exempt H-1Bs —an ideal, flexible alternative for employers like universities since they can be filed year-round without the lottery. Through The Build Fellowship’s cap-exempt solution , foreign nationals can work part-time with partner universities, enabling their primary employers to file a concurrent cap-exempt H-1B for full-time employment without lottery restrictions. This unique pathway provides stability for foreign professionals while meeting companies' hiring needs outside the standard H-1B constraints.

However, many visa holders seek extensions beyond this timeframe, especially if they are in the process of securing a green card. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about H-1B visa extensions, eligibility requirements, processes, fees, and the best strategies for a smooth extension process. Types of H-1B Extensions 1.Initial H-1B Extension (Up to 6 Years) The H-1B visa, central to the U.S. employment visa system, allows professionals in specialized fields to work in the United States for up to six years in two three-year terms. However, many visa holders seek extensions beyond this timeframe, especially if they are in the process of securing a green card. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about H-1B visa extensions, eligibility requirements, processes, fees, and the best strategies for a smooth extension process. 2. Extensions Beyond the 6-Year Cap Under the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act (AC21), H-1B visa holders can qualify for one-year or three-year extensions beyond the six-year limit if: They have an approved I-140 petition but cannot apply for a green card due to per-country limits or priority date backlogs; or They have a pending labor certification (PERM) or I-140 petition filed at least 365 days before the end of their six-year term​. Eligibility Requirements To qualify for an H-1B extension, an applicant must: Be employed in a specialty occupation by a U.S. employer. Have maintained lawful H-1B status, as evidenced by payroll documentation, I-94 records, and employment verification. If applying for a post-six-year extension, meet the specific AC21 conditions mentioned above​. Required Documents for H-1B Extension When preparing to file for an H-1B extension, gather the following essential documents: If extending beyond six years under AC21, include the I-140 approval notice or evidence of a pending PERM application to show eligibility​. Filing Process and Timeline Standard Process Filing Timeline : Employers can submit an H-1B extension petition up to six months before the visa expiration date. This early filing helps avoid gaps in employment eligibility. Processing Time : Standard processing generally takes 4 to 6 months, though it can extend up to 12 months in some cases​. You can check the latest at the USCIS case processing times page . Premium Processing For an additional $2,805, premium processing guarantees a response from USCIS within 15 calendar days. This option is recommended if the expiration date is near, as it prevents employment disruption during the extension period​. 240-Day Rule If an extension petition is filed before the visa expires, the visa holder may continue working for up to 240 days beyond the expiration date while waiting for a decision. However, travel outside the U.S. is discouraged during this period, as it can complicate the application​. Fees for H-1B Extension Traveling During the H-1B Extension Process While waiting for extension approval, avoid international travel if possible, as it can delay the process or lead to issues re-entering the U.S. Once the extension is approved, travel is generally permitted; however, you may need a new visa stamp to re-enter the country. A recent Department of State pilot program may soon allow H-1B holders to renew visa stamps from within the U.S., but this is still in the experimental stage​. H-1B Extension Denials and Next Steps Common reasons for extension denials include: Missing or incomplete documentation Employer-employee relationship issues Lack of evidence for continued specialty occupation status In case of a denial, USCIS typically provides a reason and may allow for an appeal or a Motion to Reopen (MTR). Consulting with an experienced immigration attorney can be beneficial in preparing documentation or assessing alternative options, such as filing a new petition with a different employer. Conclusion Successfully navigating an H-1B extension requires thorough documentation, timely application, and strategic planning. By understanding eligibility requirements, maintaining careful records, and preparing well in advance, H-1B holders can ensure a smoother path to securing their visa extensions. An immigration pathway to train the future U.S. workforce The Build Fellowship offers a powerful solution for foreign nationals who were not selected in the H-1B lottery, but want to continue working in the U.S. Through our partnerships with nonprofits and universities, we enable fellows to work in part-time cap-exempt H-1B roles while retaining their primary employment.
