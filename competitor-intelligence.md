## TALKING POINTS VS COMPETITORS

> "Build Fellowship requires a 5-8 hour weekly commitment to their educational program and keeps you on H-1B which ties you to employers. Our O-1 agent model gives you full independence with no ongoing requirements."

### Vs Plymouth Street
> "Plymouth serves already-qualified tech candidates. We serve the full journey - from building your profile if you score under 35%, all the way through filing. Plus, we've been doing this for 500+ cases across sports and tech."
