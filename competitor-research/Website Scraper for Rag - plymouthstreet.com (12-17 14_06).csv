Our founder, Lisa Wehden , missed the H-1B lottery in 2020 and faced an O-1 denial soon after. Rather than give up, she found the right guidance, won her case, and eventually earned her green card.

We turn a maze of forms and uncertainty into a clear, confident path for global talent. Today, we help founders, engineers, and researchers secure O-1 visas and other advanced immigration pathways to live and work in the United States.

Prior to joining Anthropic, she worked as a research engineer at DeepMind, contributing to a broad spectrum of AI research, including multi-agent reinforcement learning and human-AI interaction, and was a founding member of the Societal Impacts team at the UK AI Safety Institute. Saffron is also the co-founder of the Collective Intelligence Project, an initiative dedicated to democratizing and strengthening AI development towards the collective good. Anthropic’s Saffron Huang speaks about adapting generative AI applications to meet the needs of diverse communities and speakers of languages other than English at the Hoover Institution on September 24, 2024. (Patrick Beaudouin) ‍ From Auckland to Harvard Saffron Huang grew up in Auckland, New Zealand. She shared “Auckland was a great place to be a kid, there was a lot of time spent outside. I was an independent kid who spent a lot of time reading and browsing the internet.” Saffron moved to the United States twice — her first move was for college. Saffron recognized that “the U.S. had some of the best schools in the world and beyond just academics, she wanted to experience life outside of New Zealand. The availability of need-blind financial aid in the U.S. made studying there even more appealing. Eventually, she chose to attend Harvard University, where she earned a degree in Applied Mathematics-Computer Science with minors in Government and German. Saffron&#x27;s second move to the U.S. came after spending time in London. She found the U.S. appealing once again, noting, “It’s such a hub for talent and people that I like.” DeepMind and the Collective Intelligence Project After Harvard, Saffron joined DeepMind as a research engineer, diving deep into AI&#x27;s technical world—working on projects like language models, human-AI interaction, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. But while the technical side fascinated her, Saffron recognized that we need to direct AI more intentionally ; this led her to co-found the Collective Intelligence Project (CIP) in 2022, alongside her co-founder Divya. The Collective Intelligence Project (CIP) is an initiative focused on democratizing AI development and ensuring that it serves society equitably. Through this work, Saffron and Divya were named in the 2024 TIME 100 Most Influential People in AI list, and their work earned recognition from The New York Times. Saffron views the U.S. as a central hub for AI innovation, stating, “The U.S. is the place where a lot of AI companies are based, so naturally, a lot of things happen here.” Bletchley, United Kingdom. Saffron Huang (second from the left) of the Collective Intelligence Project attends the UK&#x27;s AI Safety Summit. Picture by Lauren Hurley / No 10 Downing Street Moving to SF — Help from Plymouth Saffron’s move to San Francisco in May 2024 has significantly impacted both her professional and personal life. After several years of moving around and securing an O-1 visa in August 2023 with help from Lisa and Plymouth, the shift to San Francisco has been a refreshing change. Compared to London, the city feels more laid-back and connected. “I can walk between friends’ houses all the time, and everything happens within the same few square miles,” she notes. On the professional side, it’s been easy to gather people and collaborate. “Ideas move to action really fast here,” she says. Saffron + Plymouth Friends at Anthropic! A word to other immigrants Although Saffron is not a self-proclaimed ""advice giver,"" she encourages more immigrants to look into the O-1 visa. To her surprise, the O-1 is much more obtainable than she initially thought, so don’t be afraid to take the leap to pursue your dreams. Disclaimer: Plymouth Street is not a law firm.

Gabriel Petersson is a research scientist at OpenAI, working on cutting-edge video generation research. His journey began when he dropped out of high school in Sweden at 17 to join the founding team at Depict.ai, a Y Combinator-backed startup. Since then, he has worked at Dataland (YC) and Midjourney. ‍ Early Projects and Minecraft? At the age of 17, Gabriel made the decision to leave high school to join Depict.ai, as a founding team member. In this role, he worked on building a product recommender system using computer vision (CNN) and natural language processing (NLP), learning on the job without formal training in engineering. For fun, at 14, he bought and sold Pokémon cards for over $20,000. At 18, he built a Minecraft server, which he subsequently monetized with an open-world RPG. Gabriel also gained millions of views on YouTube with Minecraft timelapses and led a Clash of Clans clan that was one of the first to hit 100 war wins. A cozy picnic: Gabriel hanging out with his family back in Sweden Building High-Performance Software At 19, Gabriel was recruited to become the interim CTO of Curb Food, the largest cloud kitchen in Sweden at the time, with 80 employees. In this capacity, he built a team of 7 engineers from the ground up, developing the tech systems necessary to scale the business. He successfully launched a kitchen management system into production, which streamlined operations and improved efficiency. Prior to this, at 18, Gabriel created a price comparison site for hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic, generating $22,000 in revenue in the first week. By strategically using viral-engineered Facebook posts and purchasing accounts from friends to maximize impressions, he reached 5% of the Swedish population. He also built and owned the video-call product troubleshooter at Mavenoid, a platform similar to Google Meet but with enhanced features such as live painting via WebRTC, which improved the remote support experience for users. After, Gabriel joined Dataland, another YC-backed startup, as a founding engineer. He said, “I built one of the most performant web tables in production, capable of handling hundreds of thousands of rows, filters, and sorting without losing frames.” Next, Gabriel worked at Midjourney as a software engineer. There, he built the world’s most performant web image grid, designing a custom multithreaded rendering queue and using offscreen canvas techniques to smoothly render thousands of images. Gabriel also contributed by building internal tools for hyperparameter tuning, dataset exploration, and psychometrics. Gabe’s year in Egypt: Bedouin camp near the Sinai Mountains Sora Research at OpenAI Eventually, Gabriel shifted his focus from product engineering to AI research. At OpenAI, he works as a research scientist at Sora, developing video generation systems. Gabriel has previously written about Soras potential on X:, “AI still has a world understanding problem. But it’s possible to create worlds for AIs to explore, rediscover physics from raw pixels, and create simulations for humanoids to learn.” ‍ The Road to the U.S. and the O-1 Visa Gabriel’s path to the U.S. wasn’t exactly straightforward. Initially, he set his sights on the H-1B visa, only to realize it required a college degree—a barrier for someone with no formal education. Not one to be easily discouraged, Gabriel reached out to Plymouth for advice. That’s when he discovered he might actually be eligible for the O-1 visa, designed for individuals with extraordinary abilities. I used Stack Overflow answers for the academic publishing criteria to get my O-1 visa. If you want to get into the U.S., get good lawyers who understand what matters for the government & how to stand out,"" Regarding Plymouth, Gabriel said. “They asked all the right questions and helped me identify paths I never would have thought of—things that counted towards the O-1 criteria."" ‍ Bringing engineers from Sweden who want to move to San Francisco. Closing Advice Don’t just follow what others say—think for yourself. The incentives around you are often misaligned, so it’s important to step back and find your own way. True growth comes from questioning the status quo and trusting your own judgment. ‍ Disclaimer: Plymouth Street is not a law firm.

JC Btaiche is the CEO and Founder of Fuse, a start up on a mission to accelerate the world’s transition to fusion energy - a clean, limitless, safe, and on-demand source of energy. Prior to building Fuse in the United States, JC worked on his previous venture Hestia Academy, an online education platform for teenagers in Montreal while simultaneously attending high school. A tinkerer from Lebanon Growing up in Lebanon, JC always knew he wanted to build things. Throughout his childhood he was often described as a “tinkerer” by friends and family alike – spending his free time deconstructing toys, electronics, and whatever else he could get his hands on. “I was never someone who wanted to sit in classrooms”, JC stated as he went on to describe his boundless curiosity. ‍ JC owes his interests, in large part, to his father who was a Nuclear Physicist by training. His father had studied nuclear physics in Lebanon but due to a civil war was forced to immigrate to Canada where he did not continue his career in academia. Despite this, JC picked up a physicist&#x27;s curiosity about the universe. He began to question “how does one know all these things about the universe if they’ve never been there”? As soon as the questions arose, JC set out on a path to answer them. By grade 9, he was already working in a Plasma Physics lab in Lebanon. Always on the move While working in the aforementioned physics lab JC couldn’t help but to dream bigger. He wanted to explore the universe, so he asked his professor “I want to build fusion powered rockets, how do I start?"". The professor put it bluntly ""you need to immigrate"". It was in this short exchange that JC learned in order to build something big it was going to require a move out west. Within 2 weeks of this conversation he moved to Canada through the Canadian citizenship his dad’s prior immigration journey had afforded him. After spending some time researching at McGill University and running his start up Hestia Academy, JC ran into the same problem he ran into back in Lebanon, you can’t build big enough in Canada. ‍ JC set his sights on Silicon Valley — the world’s most fertile ground for building things. He considered his goal of working on fusion technology and recognized it would require significant investment and have huge defense considerations. While other Great Powers like China and Russia are pursuing big technologies like Fusion , it became clear the only place where JC could “pursue ambitious goals while advancing values like freedom and democracy” was the U.S. Once decided on his desire to move across borders one more time, JC set out to acquire an O-1 visa, and then shortly after, get the green card through the EB1 The sky&#x27;s the limit Since moving to the U.S., JC has been able to grow Fuse, a nuclear fusion company at the forefront of clean energy innovations. Thanks to his proximity to investors in the Bay Area, Fuse has raised over $16M in venture capital. Despite his hard work in Canada, JC states the U.S. is the only place in the world he could build out his vision for Fuse. ""America is the best country because you can dream of something crazy and then go out and actually make it happen if you work hard enough"" JC has taken this same philosophy and applied it to his personal life since moving. He’s noticed that the people he gets along with most are those he’s met here in the U.S. citing “likeminded ambitions and values” that bind them together. It’s because of those very people that he has begun to explore one of his lifelong goals of flying a plane. JC now finds himself flying planes with other hobbyists out of Palo Alto and hopes to soon start going on solo flights. Advice to immigrant hopefuls Despite the O-1 visa being touted as the “extraordinary person’s visa”, according to JC getting an O-1 visa is no harder than many of your other goals. JC states “some people put a metric for their success — such as getting into their dream school or landing their dream job [...] if you think about engineering your path to work in the US as an objective it’s something you can work towards like all other things”. JC suggests finding the right people to help you make an action plan. Breaking down the O-1 visa into its individual parts and building on the criteria that were most achievable for him helped make the immigration journey less daunting.

H3: Get started today",content page,"Plymouth - Elias Almqvist Resources About Contact Login Get Started Login Get Started Elias Almqvist How I Got Here: The Journey to Building Exa San Francisco, California. Elias Almqvist, founder and CEO of Exa, has always been driven by a desire to create transformative technologies. At the helm of Exa, he is spearheading the development of energy-efficient AI chips that are superior to traditional GPUs in speed and energy efficiency. His journey to Silicon Valley&#x27;s innovation epicenter began in the quiet, unassuming town of Eklanda, Sweden—a stark contrast to the fast-paced, high-tech world he now helps define. ‍ Growing Up in Eklanda, Sweden Eklanda at Sunset. Elias grew up in Eklanda, a quiet suburb on the outskirts of Gothenburg. “It was very quiet… I grew up in a small town, pretty standard middle-class family stuff,” he recalls. “People really enjoyed their structures. Must follow procedures, rules, and everything that makes creativity impossible. I was a very ambitious kid and the default response was always ‘that’s not possible.’” This environment, where unconventional thinking was usually discouraged, left Elias feeling isolated. “If I’m going to be honest, I was an outcast,” he admits. “No one really understood me, and every other kid was too focused on whatever was popular at the time. I think I was the only kid who had an obsessive interest in tech, and at the start, I got ridiculed for it."" ‍ he says. “It was hard because I couldn’t be myself, I had to be someone else. ” Despite the challenges, Elias found a small group of friends who would stick by him. “There were some great times though. I did find some friends who I’m still friends with to this day,” he reflects. “I’m an only child, but those people I&#x27;d call my brothers.” Discovering a Love for Tech YC Demo Day Elias’s passion for technology ignited at a young age. “My father introduced me to computers when I was about 8 years old, and I was of course hooked,” he recalls. “I got my first computer at 9, then everything just snowballed from there.” Growing up in a small town that didn’t exactly encourage unconventional thinking, Elias found solace in his early exposure to technology. “I mostly just kept to myself, learning whatever I thought was interesting, mostly programming and building random things,” he says. While other kids were consumed by fleeting trends, Elias’s curiosity about technology allowed him to carve out his own space. “I wanted to be an inventor, but that was before I knew what a founder was. It’s the same thing really.” Elias’s self-taught journey in tech became the foundation for his future ambitions. His early experiences in tech were a direct response to a stifling environment, where his interests often went unnoticed. “It was tough, but it also fueled my drive to build something bigger."" Pursuing High-Risk Projects “People are very risk-averse in Sweden. Risks are frowned upon, and success is not celebrated the same way ,” he says. “Most of the time when I said I wanted to build something, or do something, or even learn something, the default response was &#x27;that&#x27;s not possible.’ You need to have a degree or some sort of validation from the system to be taken seriously. But I didn’t care about that. I just did it anyway.” ‍ The Move to Silicon Valley Little Elias under the Golden Gate Bridge Elias realized that to truly bring his vision to life, he needed to leave Sweden and embrace the broader opportunities the world had to offer. “I’ve always loved Silicon Valley. I’ve always been drawn here,” he says, reflecting on his decision to move. “All roads lead to SF. It was inevitable. Silicon Valley is great because of the people and culture. Everyone is building something amazing, and people are also very supportive and kind.” ‍ Elias’s O-1 visa journey was a crucial step in making his vision a reality in the U.S. Plymouth was great, got all the docs ready and everything, drafted the petition quickly, and got the O-1 approved in 10 days ,” he says. The decision to move to San Francisco, though a significant step, proved to be the right one for Elias and Exa. “Silicon Valley or San Francisco is great because everyone knows that some random kid from some random place in the world can come here and build the next generational company. Compared to Sweden, it’s not like that at all. There’s a different level of opportunity here that encourages innovation and risk-taking.” Building Exa Elias’s vision with Exa is clear: “Exa is making energy-efficient AI chips that are reconfigurable and can optimize the data flows of each model,” he says. “We’re solving two major problems. One is energy consumption, the other is hardware bias in AI research. Current GPUs just aren’t built for what we need. They’re not sustainable, and they favor linear models that aren’t capable of learning.” The energy inefficiency of current AI chips is something Elias is passionate about solving. “The current state-of-the-art NVIDIA chips are around 1.2kW per unit, which is insane!” he exclaims. “Data centers consume 2% of the global energy right now, and it’s expected to become 20-30% by 2030. We have to change that.” On the second problem, he adds, “We need models that can learn in a more flexible, advanced way. GPUs favor more linear computations (e.g. matmul etc.), but AI models are non-linear and probabilistic in nature. That’s why we’re focused on building reconfigurable chips that can handle the unique and complex dataflows of these models. Everyone else is focused on the popular thing - it&#x27;s time to move beyond.” Advice for Future Immigrant Founders Elias is focused on leaving a lasting impact. “I intend to leave a legacy, and I intend to fight for humanity and the people I care about,” he says. “Anything less than that isn’t worth mentioning.” For Elias, the work he’s doing at Exa is about creating the tools that will power future breakthroughs. “If we just had the right computational capabilities, we could solve problems that people would’ve thought were impossible just a few years ago,” he says. “AI isn’t about chatbots or generating images. It’s about gaining further knowledge about the universe, and that won’t happen without the right hardware.” ‍ Elias believes that the key to success lies in starting without hesitation and pursuing what truly excites you. He stresses the importance of picking an ambitious goal and dedicating yourself to it fully, no matter the obstacles. For him, the journey is about unwavering commitment and ignoring the voices of doubt, even when others may try to discourage or slow you down.

They provide spreadsheets, coding, and simple automation, helping users connect their applications and code automated workflows, build useful tools, and enrich data sets. The Challenge: Clay recently hired an exceptional candidate and needed to quickly transfer their O-1 visa. Initial conversations with a law firm proved to be slow with poor communication, which prompted the company to seek a more quick and effective solution. With time being a critical factor, the company needed a swift and reliable resolution to ensure the seamless onboarding of the valuable new team member. The Solution: Recognizing the need for prompt action, Plymouth formulated a streamlined plan to expedite the O-1 visa transfer process. With a commitment to clear communication and proactive problem-solving, Plymouth aimed to provide a stark contrast to the previous experience. We had just hired an amazing candidate and needed to get their O-1 visa transferred. The law firm we were working with was slow, poor communicators, and I never had faith it would get done well. Speed was of the essence, so I made one midnight call to Lisa Wehden and the rest was smooth sailing. They were so good it was almost unbelievable. They really should be your first call for anything immigration-related. The Result: Thanks to Plymouth’s speed and expertise, the Clay employee submitted their application within a week and the visa was approved just a few days later.

Previously, Lindy&#x27;s founder Flo Crivello believed that remote work was best, but ultimately decided that there’s no replacement for in-person collaboration and the networking that San Francisco provides. ‍ The Lindy team worked with Plymouth to help relocate three of their employees, including the Head of Go-To-Market who was told by other providers that they weren’t eligible for an O1 visa. Plymouth was also able to complete the process in half the time of other providers. The Challenge: Lindy needed to relocate three team members from Trinidad, Vancouver, and London to San Francisco for their return to an office, and quickly. Additionally, while working with another firm, their Head of Go-To-Market, based in Vancouver, was told they were not eligible for an O1 visa. The Solution: Plymouth was able to help these team members save time and setbacks by streamlining the immigration process and providing updates every step of the way. They also explored the O1 visa requirements to craft a narrative that made their Head of Go-To-Market an attractive candidate for the O1 visa. ""We had an incredibly smooth experience with Plymouth - exactly what we were hoping for. Their constant communication and helpful updates on deadlines made everything seamless. It was easy to convey our needs, and our team particularly enjoyed speaking with the team, which always left us feeling confident about our petition. The case strategy and positioning played a significant role in boosting our confidence, with Plymouth reassuring us at every step, &#x27;You can do this.&#x27; Absolutely no pain points in working with them!"" — Lindy Drope, Head of Go-To-Market The Result: Thanks to Plymouth, Lindy was able to relocate three of their critical team members to their San Francisco office in less than 6 weeks for each case — quite the opposite of the lengthy ordeal that other providers proposed. The Lindy team is now able to collaborate and network in person in San Francisco without sacrificing any brilliant team members.

The O-1 visa opens up many opportunities for individuals with extraordinary talents and abilities in the sciences, education, business, or athletics. You can read more about the O-1 visa here . How to Move from F-1 to O-1 Visa 1. Assess your eligibility. Before making the leap, take some time to evaluate if you meet the eligibility criteria for the O-1 visa. You must either have received a major, internationally recognized award or meet at least three of the criteria below: You are a member of an association in the field that requires outstanding achievements; There are published material in professional or major media about you; You have judged the work of others in the field; You have made original contributions of major significance; You have written scholarly articles in professional journals or other major media; You have been employed in a critical or essential capacity for organizations of distinguished reputation; and You have received a high salary or other remuneration. In addition to satisfying at least three criteria, USCIS also evaluates the totality of all the evidence to determine whether you have extraordinary ability in science, education, business, or athletics. 2. Gather your documents. Collect evidence showcasing your extraordinary achievements – think awards, publications, letters of recommendation, or anything else that can back up your eligibility above. You’ll need to submit these with your application. 3. Find a sponsor. Unlike the F-1, the O-1 requires a U.S. employer or agent to act as your sponsor. This could be an individual or an organization willing to vouch for your exceptional abilities. 4. File the petition. Once you&#x27;ve confirmed eligibility, organized the documents, and obtained a sponsor, it&#x27;s time to file the O-1 petition. Your sponsor will submit the necessary paperwork to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on your behalf. Patience is key during this stage. 5. Prepare for the interview. If USCIS approves your petition, get ready to conduct an interview. This is your chance to show off your personality, expertise, and why you&#x27;re a perfect candidate for the O-1 visa. Transitioning from an F-1 to an O-1 visa is an exciting step towards unlocking new opportunities and pursuing your passions in the United States.

Researchers and scientists often qualify for the O-1 visa, as their academic achievements map directly to the eligibility criteria. A PhD alone does not grant eligibility, but it can contribute to meeting the criteria. In this post, we’ll walk you through what you need to know about applying for the O-1 visa as a scientist or academic researcher. O-1 Visa Requirements To be eligible for the O-1 visa, you must either have received a major, internationally recognized award or meet at least three of the criteria below: You have written scholarly articles in professional journals or other major media; You have judged the work of others in the field; You have been employed in a critical or essential capacity for organizations of distinguished reputation; You are a member of an association in the field that requires outstanding achievements; There are published material in professional or major media about you; You have made original contributions of major significance; You have received a high salary or other remuneration How to Fulfill the O-1 Requirements as an Academic Researcher The key to the O-1 visa application is demonstrating your outstanding achievements, accolades, publications, and contributions to your field. Here are some examples of how to fulfill 3 out of the 8 criteria: Authorship Authoring peer-reviewed articles or technical reports in reputable scientific journals or industry publications. Presenting research at conferences and workshops, with a strong record of published papers or invited talks. Judging or reviewing others&#x27; work Participating as a reviewer of abstracts or papers submitted for presentation at scholarly conferences in the respective field. Peer reviewer for scholarly publications, member of doctoral dissertation committees, or peer reviewer for government research funding programs. Critical Role Working in a research lab or academic department in your field of expertise, a principal or named investigator for a department, institution, or business that received a merit-based government award. Founder or co-founder of, or contributor of intellectual property to, a startup business that has a distinguished reputation. Original Contributions Achieving over 100+ citations for your academic articles or technical reports. Authoring patents for novel technologies that achieve utilization in the field. Published Materials Presenting your research at prominent national or international conferences. Achieving press in major media for your work in the field. Memberships Membership in notable organizations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) or The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Awards Awards from well-known national institutions and well-known professional associations, certain doctoral dissertation awards and Ph.D. scholarships, and awards recognizing presentations at nationally or internationally recognized conferences. In addition, you’ll need to gather evidence to support that you fulfill at least three of the requirements above. This can include things like: Proof of employment in a research lab Any written work you’ve authored or contributed to Proof of membership in an academic or professional organization in your field Press coverage of you or your work Conference presentations Awards or grants Letters of recommendation from colleagues USCIS isn’t just looking for self-proclaimed greatness; they want to see that your peers recognize your brilliance too. Letters of recommendation from established figures in your field carry significant weight for the petition. Do I need a job offer for an O-1 Visa? Yes — the O-1 visa requires a job offer. A copy of the written employment contract between you and your U.S. employer (petitioner) needs to be included. You won’t get the visa if there isn’t a work-related reason to come here. If you don’t have a work contract, you have to provide emails regarding your agreement to work for your employer. The O-1 Visa is an excellent pathway to the United States for many brilliant and successful individuals, including academic researchers.

At 5, he picked up a tennis racket for fun and by 10, he was competing nationally. In his first official tournament match, he came back from seven match points down to win in a tiebreaker, a moment he now sees as a turning point. That same year, he won the national championship, and again at age 12, while training 15 hours a week and keeping up with school. “Tennis is a beautiful sport but it’s also incredibly lonely,” he said. “That pressure forces you to grow fast.” He credits the sport with building his discipline, mental strength, and focus under pressure. Outside of competition, Ahmed stayed grounded by a strong group of friends and a social life he describes as just as formative as his time on the court. Early Exposure to Tech Ahmed’s exposure to tech began at home; his father was a tech entrepreneur, and he got his first computer when he was just 4 years old. But it wasn’t coding tutorials or spreadsheets that pulled him in, it was games! Alongside his tennis training, Ahmed spent hours playing competitive Counter-Strike and uploading Call of Duty gameplay videos to YouTube. “Some of those videos are still online today” and through gaming, he built close friendships and discovered what it felt like to be fully immersed in something he loved. By the time he was 15, he knew he wanted to recreate that experience for others which was to build games that sparked joy, connection, and community. ‍ That decision led him to pursue Computer Science. During undergrad, he built and published seven original games — designing, developing, and shipping each one on his own. His most successful title, Shapion , was downloaded over 2,000 times on Android and iOS, earning positive feedback for its playability and polish. As he honed his technical skills, Ahmed’s curiosity started to shift toward machine learning. That curiosity led him to Revolut, where he joined as the company’s first-ever intern and began applying his background in both gaming and software. Shapion UI ‍ Choosing San Francisco for Growth and Community Ahmed has been visiting San Francisco every year since 2016, where his older brother Youssef lives. “I absolutely love San Francisco. Having him there is a big part of why I’m moving. He’s inspired me my whole life, and I want to spend more time with him.” The decision to move was driven in part by family, but more importantly by environment. Ahmed wanted to be in a place that pushed him to be his best. “If you want to become Roger Federer, you need to play against Nadal and Djokovic,” he said. “You can’t become the best unless you’re playing with the best. For me, San Francisco is that court. It’s where I find the top players in what I do. I love being surrounded by people who are insanely ambitious and deeply passionate about tech. It just fits me.” Ahmed and family! Building Nativ “I’m building a company called Nativ with a close friend of mine, who was my colleague as Revolut and also my manager at the last startup I worked at, XYZ Reality. At Nativ, we’re focused on visual content culturalization : adapting images and videos to fit different cultures and countries. This helps businesses market and sell their products globally, instead of being limited to just one region.” ‍ ‍ Companies already try to localize today, but according to Ahmed, there are two major problems. “First, it’s a completely manual process. For each country, businesses need to hire translators and find a localization agency to handle the work. This is slow, expensive, and painful, especially when you’re dealing with thousands of visual assets a month,” he said. “Second, they’re limited to the regions where they have existing vendor relationships. I’ve talked to many companies that avoid entire regions like the Middle East or North Africa (where I’m from), just because they don’t know anyone who can help or they find Arabic too complex.” For Ahmed, this represents a massive missed opportunity—both for companies and for global consumers. “That means they’re leaving huge growth opportunities untapped, and consumers in those regions miss out on amazing products.” ‍ His vision with Nativ is to change that. “Now imagine if it were extremely easy to take your content and launch it anywhere in the world. More companies would expand globally, revenues would grow, and more people would get access to content that actually speaks their language and culture,” he said. For Ahmed, the breakthrough is clear: “We believe AI is the unlock. For the first time, we have technology that truly understands cultural nuances and we’re using it to solve a painful, expensive, and overlooked problem that is gigantic.” Navigating the O-1 with Plymouth Street “My experience was extremely smooth! I reached out to Lisa because she was recommended to me from a friend. We had a call in mid-January to start the process, she asked a few questions then I got onboarded onto the platform where I uploaded a few documents and got 4 reference letters signed. 1.5 months later, I got my approval. It honestly couldn’t have been easier! I’d definitely recommend Plymouth to anybody applying for an O-1. They did a fantastic job.” ‍ Advice from Ahmed ""Find people who inspire you and push you to be the best version of yourself, and spend as much time as possible with them. Early on, the people you surround yourself with matter more than anything. Whatever you build, whether it’s a startup, a side project, or a mission, you’ll almost always be building it with others. That could be a co-founder, a friend, or an early team. Choosing the right people is the single most important thing you can do to maximize your chances of building something meaningful and lasting.” Later he shares that ""Our brains are wired for comfort, which is why change is hard. It takes real character to break away from that and choose the uncomfortable path in order to do what you love and, in doing so, inspire others to do the same. I’ve been lucky to grow up surrounded by people like that from a very young age. They’ve shaped who I am and continue to push me to be the best version of myself every day.” Future Contributions and Impact Ahmed’s deeper goal is to create momentum for others and his conclusion is that the most important thing I can do is empower more people to chase their dreams. ""That dream could be starting a tech company, opening a coffee shop, or launching a clothing brand, it really doesn’t matter. What matters is that they’re doing what they love. When someone tells me, ‘You’ve inspired me to go after my dream,’ it’s the most beautiful thing I can hear,” he said. He’s seen firsthand how many talented people never take that leap — not because they lack ability, but because they’re stuck in routine or feel pressured to make safe decisions. ‍ “I want to give younger generations permission to be more entrepreneurial, to take risks, and to create the life they actually want,” he said. After going through a16z’s Speedrun accelerator with Nativ, the company he co-founded, Ahmed now regularly takes time to help early-stage founders with fundraising, product ideas, and application reviews. He’ll jump on calls with people he barely knows if it means helping someone move one step closer to shipping their vision. ‍ Disclaimer: Plymouth Street is not a law firm.

Kamila Stepniowska is a leading advocate for diversity in open source scientific computing. She works at NumFOCUS, a nonprofit that promotes and supports open source scientific computing. Prior to her current ventures, she was a serial entrepreneur and sociology researcher. Navigating childhood in a changing Warsaw Kamila was born in Warsaw, Poland in 1986. The time was marked by significant changes as the world had entered the late Cold War era. Poland experienced significant political, economic, and social impacts in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster and the rule of a communist party. Warsaw being the nation’s capital left it at the epicenter of the swathing changes, and Kamila bore the full brunt of the country’s transformation. ‍ Kamila does recall one clear inflection point: high school. Having grown up in the Grochow district which “wasn’t very safe at the time”, Kamila had grown accustomed to an under-resourced education. It wasn’t until Kamila earned admission to a really great high school in a neighboring district that she “realized she could do a lot with her life”. Learning inside and outside the classroom High school was another period of change for Kamila. At her new school she made friends with affluent children of academics and business owners. In class, the material had begun to shift towards a more comprehensive curriculum that emphasized critical thinking with subjects like literature, Latin, basics of law, philosophy, theory of probability, and civic society. Outside of class, Kamila grew involved with the school’s volunteering initiatives, theater program, and choir. The combination of these first-hand experiences with class, academia, welfare, community and acting made her grow curious “about people, how they interact, what makes power structures, and what makes decision structures”. It was for this reason Kamila decided to pursue further education obtaining a Bachelor’s, Master’s, and PhD(c) in Sociology. Searching for a fairly tale story Starting a career in the startup space, Kamila quickly noticed a common train of thought amongst Warsaw’s tech tribe ... “We have the startups, we have the brilliant people, where is the capital?"" The answer to that question was rhetorical, with everyone knowing it was in the US. Kamila’s fascination with the US grew as she learned of its inclusive culture, stating she believed “we can all succeed in the US, just like they do in fairy tales”. While members of Warsaw’s tech tribe traveled a bit and settled down, Kamila held out for the US. Building a global organization Kamila’s hope for her work is that it has a local and global impact. With 12 years experience working in tech, including AI, she knew the easiest way to accomplish this is to work locally in the US due to its “global influence and access to capital”. The US is one of the only places where you can host an event in your local city, say San Francisco, and have word expand globally. ‍ Since moving to the US, newfound access to capital and reach has allowed her to support local leaders from all over the world. For example, currently NumFOCUS is hosting a series of workshops on Deep Learning in Kampala, Uganda. ‍ Professionally, San Franciscio has “opened so many doors” giving Kamila direct access to the “mecca of AI”. Being surrounded by leading technology companies and networks have informed her work at an NGO, expanded her own set of skills and knowledge, and unlocked new partnerships and funding opportunities for her work promoting open source projects. Building a global organization Since immigrating to the US, Kamila has noted feeling a sense of tranquility. Perhaps it is the bay’s beautiful flora and fauna, which has kickstarted a new found hobby of hikes and climbing. Or maybe it’s the freedom to develop yourself in a direction that you choose to and a confidence that hard work will pay off in this country. Kamila noted the diversity of people concentrated in San Francisco makes it common to find people different from you. When being distinct from the rest of the crowd is so commonplace, people are empowered to do whatever they want and feel comfortable knowing they won’t be judged. While those are all contributors to Kamila’s newfound sense of peace, the most significant has been a gradual shift in thinking over the years. In Poland, “because of the historic traumas, the traumas still feel alive” and she finds herself carrying the emotional baggage. For Kamila and those around her, the baggage manifested itself into a closed mindset. Living in the US, Kamila has started to develop a growth mindset. She shared, “It’s about asking how can I get to the point where I want to be, instead of asking what obstacles would I face along the way. Being solution focused . ” Her time in the bay has allowed her to find the right people and, subsequently, the drive to accomplish anything. ‍ A word to other immigrants Kamila’s biggest tip for fellow immigrants looking to make the move to the US is to apply their growth mindset to their immigration journey. It is so common for founders and builders to shoot for the stars when it comes to their business, but they don’t always apply the same sort of thinking to their immigration journeys. She states... “Don’t set barriers for yourself. Step back and ask yourself does the barrier factually exist? Or did you create it?” Disclaimer: Plymouth Street is not a law firm.

One team member was moving off of their spouse’s visa, and one needed a green card. While working with Plymouth, these individuals were able to quickly and efficiently submit visa applications and continue working in the United States. The Challenge: Living Carbon decided to sponsor two of their employees – a Research Scientist and Commercial Lead and – who needed visas in the United States. One of them was previously on their spouse’s visa and was told they weren’t eligible for the O1 by other providers. The other needed a green card to stay in the United States and needed assistance with the EB1A visa. The Solution: Plymouth was able to help these team members save time and setbacks by streamlining the immigration process and providing updates every step of the way. They helped each employee explore the O1 and EB1A visas and determine which was the best for them. ""It was incredible how quick and efficient the Plymouth Street Team are!

About LangChain Headquarters: San Francisco Employee Count: 21 Founders: Harrison Chase, Ankush Gola Industry: Technology Software Title of Table Discover how LangChain&#x27;s strategic move to partner with Plymouth earlier this year delivered impressive results. Previously, LangChain faced a frustrating and prolonged immigration process with another provider, stretching up to six months without success. Plymouth, however, delivered a successful approval in a mere six weeks. The Challenge LangChain&#x27;s collaboration with a previous immigration service resulted in significant setbacks, consuming considerable time for the founders and team. The objective was critical: to relocate a top-tier remote engineer from London to their San Francisco HQ. ‍ Brie, a Manager at LangChain, described the challenge “The process felt like navigating through a maze of tiny, irregular hoops— far from straightforward. Our team celebrated when we could fire that firm”. The Solution Plymouth partnered with LangChain to streamline the O1 immigration process. The choice was driven by Plymouth’s reputation for excellence in service, rapid turnaround, and their tailored, best-in-class O1 pathway package. “Plymouth’s efficiency was remarkable—just six weeks in total. The team brought a personal touch to the experience, ensuring our people were well taken care of without losing sight of the human aspect. Plymouth provided a clear checklist and handled the heavy lifting. It was exactly the seamless support we initially sought—comprehensive and thoughtful, allowing us to focus on our business rather than immigration technicalities.” — Brie Wolfson, LangChain Marketing Manager The Result Thanks to Plymouth, LangChain achieved the swift onboarding of a crucial engineering talent in six weeks—a stark contrast to the six-month ordeal previously faced. Before engaging Plymouth, LangChain’s team had sunk nearly a hundred hours into fruitless exchanges with immigration attorneys. Plymouth&#x27;s intervention reclaimed those hours and spared the company thousands of dollars in potential costs.

The O-1 visa is for individuals with extraordinary abilities or achievements in their field. Whether you&#x27;re an artist, scientist, entrepreneur, or expert in your field, this visa could be your golden ticket. We break down the O-1 visa more in this blog post . How to Move from J-1 to O-1 Visa 1. Check the Two-Year Home Residency Requirement: Some J-1 visa holders may be subject to a two-year home residency requirement, which means they must return to their home country or country of last permanent residence for at least two years before being eligible for certain other U.S. visas . You’ll need to check to see if this applies to you before applying for another visa. 2. Assess your eligibility. Before making the leap, take some time to evaluate if you meet the eligibility criteria for the O-1 visa. This includes demonstrating extraordinary abilities or achievements, receiving national or international recognition, and having a job offer from a U.S. employer. 3. Gather your documents. Collect evidence showcasing your extraordinary achievements – think awards, publications, testimonials, or anything else that proves you&#x27;re at the top of your game. Your future employer will also need to provide a detailed job offer, so make sure you communicate that to them. 4. Find a sponsor. Unlike the J-1, the O-1 requires a U.S. employer or agent to act as your sponsor. This could be an individual or an organization willing to vouch for your exceptional abilities. Your current employer may be willing to sponsor you, or you may have an offer from a different employer that’ll vouch for you. 5. File the petition. Once you&#x27;ve confirmed eligibility, organized the documents, and obtained a sponsor, it&#x27;s time to file the O-1 petition. Your sponsor will submit the necessary paperwork to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on your behalf. Patience is key during this stage. 6. Prepare for the interview. If USCIS approves your petition, get ready to conduct an interview. This is your chance to show off your personality, expertise, and why you&#x27;re a perfect candidate for the O-1 visa. You can learn more about how to crush the O-1 interview here . Transitioning from a J-1 to an O-1 visa may seem like a daunting process, but with the right preparation and confidence, you&#x27;ll be on your way to your next adventure in the United States.

The visa appointment, conducted at U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide, is the final step to demonstrate your eligibility for certain visas. It’s important to make a good first impression at your visa appointment; the embassy and consular officers have a big impact on your visa approval process. Here are some tips for making your visa interview impactful: 1. Dress professionally. Dressing professionally shows your professionalism, respect for the process, and can leave a positive impression on the consular officer. 2. Be punctual. Arriving late can negatively impact your interview, so plan to arrive well in advance of your appointment time and give yourself some wiggle room for traffic, public transit mishaps, or any other event that could stand in the way of making it on time. 3. Be honest and transparent. Always provide honest and direct answers to the consular officer&#x27;s questions. If you&#x27;re unsure about something, it&#x27;s totally fine to admit it. 4. If you have additional documents such as letters of recommendation, awards, or publications, bring copies of them along to strengthen your application. 5. Prepare for questions. Expect questions related to your qualifications and achievements. Be ready to discuss your work and its significance in your field. This is the time to really showcase why you go above and beyond in your industry, and why you deserve a chance to showcase those skills in the United States. 6. Keep calm and stay positive. Nervousness is totally normal, but try to remain calm and composed during the interview. Project confidence in your abilities, even if you are super nervous in the moment. 7. Before the interview, revisit your visa application and the information provided in your DS-160 form . Being familiar with all the details of your application can help you answer questions confidently. Other No items found.

The B-1 Visa, known as the Temporary Business Visitor Visa, allows visitors to come to the United States temporarily to participate in business-related activities. It falls under the non-immigrant category and serves the dual purpose of facilitating business trips (B-1) and tourism (B-2), or even a combination of both (B1/B2). This means you can come to the United States for meetings, conferences, research, and general tourism. How long is the B-1 Visa valid? One of the perks of the B-1 visa is its flexibility. Typically valid for up to a decade from the date of issue, it grants travelers a stay of up to six months (180 days) per visit. If you find yourself wanting to stay for longer, you can extend your visa for an additional six months.

The H1-B visa is designed for individuals in specialty occupations who want to temporarily live and work in the United States. However, the H1-B visa can be a bit complicated, so we’ll walk you through the details and how to apply. It’s important to note that there are a limited number of H1-B visas awarded each year. The H1-B visa filing period usually opens on April 1st for employment starting on October 1st of the same year. Who is eligible for an H1-B visa? The H1-B visa is a temporary work visa designed for foreign professionals with specialized knowledge and skills. If you&#x27;re a tech whiz, a marketing guru, or an expert in your field, this could be your ticket to working in the U.S. Essentially, it allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations. What qualifies as a “specialty occupation”? Specialty occupations are roles that require a high level of specialized knowledge, usually obtained through a bachelor&#x27;s degree or other form of higher education. This could include roles in IT, engineering, healthcare, finance, and more. If you&#x27;ve got the skills and the credentials, you&#x27;ve met the first requirement for the H1-B visa. What is the H1-B visa lottery? The United States government sets a cap for the number of H1-B visas awarded each year. There are usually more applications than available slots, and as a result, a lottery system is used to randomly select petitions that will be processed for further consideration. There are two main caps for H1-B visas: the regular cap and the advanced degree cap. The regular cap is set at 65,000 visas, and an additional 20,000 visas are available under the advanced degree cap for individuals with a U.S. master&#x27;s degree or higher. If the number of petitions received exceeds the cap, a random lottery is conducted to select the petitions that will be processed. First, the lottery is conducted for the advanced degree cap. Any unselected petitions from this pool are then added to the general pool, and a second lottery is conducted to select the remaining petitions. Petitioners whose applications are selected in the lottery are notified by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Those not selected in the lottery are returned, along with their filing fees. Note: certain petitions, such as those filed by institutions of higher education and certain nonprofit entities, are exempt from the annual cap. Can I bring family members on an H1-B visa? Yes! The H1-B visa allows you to bring your spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 with you. They can even attend school in the U.S. if they choose. They’ll need to separately apply for the H-4 visa, which is specifically for dependents of H1-B visa holders. How long is an H1-B visa? The H1-B visa is typically granted for an initial period of three years, but you can extend it for another three, and there’s potential for more extensions depending on your circumstances. The H1-B Application Process Find a US employer. Before anything else, secure a job with a U.S. employer willing to sponsor your H1-B visa. The position should fall under the category of a ""specialty occupation"" and typically requires a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. Your employer files a Labor Condition Application (LCA). This application includes information about your job including wages, working conditions, and location for your position. Your employer submits form I-129 petition. Once the LCA is approved, your employer files Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This form outlines the specifics of the job and your qualifications. USCIS may request additional documentation. If your I-29 petition is approved, you’ll receive a Form I-797, Notice of Action, indicating that your petition was accepted. If there are any issues, USCIS may issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) seeking more information. You can learn more about RFEs here . Consular Processing or Change of Status If you&#x27;re outside the U.S., you&#x27;ll need to undergo consular processing at a U.S. embassy or consulate in your home country. If you&#x27;re already in the U.S., you can apply for a change of status using Form I-539. Consular processing requires attending a visa interview. Bring all required documentation to the visa interview, including your Form I-797, valid passport, visa application forms, and supporting evidence of your qualifications. Approval and entry If approved, you&#x27;ll receive an H1-B visa stamp in your passport. If you changed your status within the U.S., you&#x27;ll receive an updated Form I-797. You can then work for the sponsoring employer in the designated specialty occupation. Remember, the H1-B visa process can be complex, and it&#x27;s crucial to stay informed and seek professional guidance when necessary.

What exactly is it, and what does it mean for your visa application process? Let&#x27;s break it down in simple terms. What is a USCIS Request for Evidence? Once you’ve submitted your visa application and are awaiting a response, you may get a USCIS Request for Evidence or RFE. USCIS stands for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. A Request for Evidence or RFE is simply a document that asks for additional information or clarification regarding your application. Remember, the key to any good visa application is evidence to support your story. When there is missing evidence, it can be hard to understand your situation and process your application appropriately. Common Reasons for USCIS RFEs Incomplete documentation Sometimes, your application may be missing a crucial document or piece of information. The USCIS wants to ensure they have all the necessary details to make an informed decision. Unclear or insufficient information Your application might contain information that is unclear or not detailed enough. USCIS wants to eliminate any confusion by requesting additional evidence to support your case. Issues with Supporting Evidence If the evidence you provided doesn&#x27;t fully substantiate your eligibility, the USCIS might ask for more compelling proof. This is not uncommon, as immigration officers are thorough in their evaluations. How to respond to a USCIS RFE Receiving an RFE isn&#x27;t a rejection; it&#x27;s an opportunity to strengthen your case. Here are some steps to navigate this part of the immigration process. Read carefully. Take the time to thoroughly read the USCIS RFE notice. Understand the specific information or documents they are requesting. Organize your response Create a comprehensive and organized response. Address each point raised in the RFE and provide the necessary documentation to support your case. Meet the deadline USCIS typically provides a deadline for responding to the RFE. It&#x27;s crucial to submit your response within the specified timeframe to avoid delays in processing. Consult professionals If the request seems confusing or overwhelming, consider consulting with immigration experts. Here at Plymouth, we help people like you through the immigration process. Get in contact with us here . Although it can be a bit of a frustrating hurdle, a USCIS Request for Evidence is not the end of your United States immigration journey.

What is the DS-160 form? The DS-160 is the Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application form used by anyone who’s applying for a U.S. visa. It is an electronic form that collects information about your background, purpose of travel, and other relevant details. We’ll walk you through the steps to completing the DS-160, hopefully making it easier for you to complete the first step in your visa journey. Where can I find the DS-160 form? The DS-160 form is available on the official website of the U.S. Department of State. You can access it through the Consular Electronic Application Center (CEAC) here . How to Complete the DS-160 Access the form. You’ll first need a secure and reliable internet connection so you can visit the Consular Electronic Application Center (CEAC) website . Create an account if you haven&#x27;t already, and select ""DS-160"" from the list of available forms. Remember to save your application ID – you&#x27;ll need it later. Fill out the personal information section. The first section of the DS-160 is for your personal information. Make sure you’re providing accurate and honest information, and double-check to make sure things like your passport details and the spelling of your name match your travel documents. Upload your photo. Upload a photo taken in the last 6 months that meets the US visa photo requirements. This photo should be in color, have a white or off-white background, and show you directly facing the camera with your face in focus. You must have a neutral facial expression (sorry, no smiles here) and not be wearing any glasses. You can find the full requirements here . Share your travel itinerary and US contact(s). Include your travel itinerary and let them know who you&#x27;ll spend time with while visiting. It’s important to be as detailed and specific as possible here. You’ll also need to know the address of the place you’ll be staying when you first arrive. This can be a hotel, AirBnb, or friend’s place. Complete the security and background screening. This part of the application includes questions about your personal history, travel history, and other factors that may be relevant to security concerns. They will vary depending on the type of visa you’re applying for, but common questions ask about previous travel to the U.S., criminal history, health history, employment and education, and family ties. Review your details and submit. Proofreading is essential here. Make sure that all of your details are correct and that you answered all the questions truthfully and accurately. You don’t want your application to get flagged for a typo. Once you’re all sorted, hit the submit button. While the DS-160 is a pretty straightforward process, there are some important things to keep in mind while completing a DS-160 form. Save your application regularly. There’s nothing worse than losing all the progress you’ve made just because you didn’t hit the save button. Plus, the DS-160 allows you to save your progress and return to the application later if you can’t do it all at once. Just remember that the information entered in the DS-160 form is only valid for 30 days. After that, you will need to start a new application. Use a computer with a stable and secure internet connection. This form works best on a desktop computer rather than a smartphone or tablet. Make sure your internet connection is reliable so you don’t risk losing your progress (or worse, compromising your personal information). Print the confirmation page. It contains important information and you’ll need it for your visa interview. Have your information ready. This includes your passport, travel itinerary, contacts in the U.S., and any previous travel history. Make sure that the information you provide on the DS-160 form is accurate and aligns with your documentation. Seek professional assistance if needed. Completing the DS-160 form doesn’t have to be a headache. Take it step by step, and if you need any assistance, feel free to reach out to our immigration experts to help guide you through the process.

As a startup founder, you may have heard about the O-1 visa, a pathway to working in the United States. However sometimes it’s unclear whether startup founders qualify for the O-1 visa for individuals with extraordinary talents and expertise. To make sure you&#x27;re on the right track, let’s make sure that the O-1 visa is best for you as a startup founder. Startups: A Unique Case for the O-1 Visa Entrepreneurs and startup founders are unique cases in the O-1 visa world. The standard O-1 visa criteria focus on fields where you can demonstrate extraordinary abilities, like winning prestigious awards, authoring critically acclaimed work, or having a significant track record of success in your industry. In the startup world, your achievements might not be as conventionally recognized, but they can still apply to the O-1 visa. As a startup founder, you can indeed apply for an O-1 visa if you can demonstrate your extraordinary abilities and achievements in your field. While the process might be unique compared to more typical O-1 visa categories, with the right documentation, a compelling business plan, and expert guidance, you can carve a path for your entrepreneurial journey in the United States. Documenting Your Extraordinary Abilities If you&#x27;re a startup founder looking at the O-1 visa, here are a few ways you can document your extraordinary abilities as required by the visa: 1. Awards and recognitions If you&#x27;ve received any awards or recognitions for your entrepreneurial work, include them in your application. These could be industry awards, grants, or startup competitions. ‍ 2. Media coverage If your startup has garnered media attention, compile articles, features, or interviews that highlight your work. ‍ 3. Investor and partner support Strong support from notable investors, venture capitalists, or influential partners can be a significant plus for your O1 visa application. ‍ 4. Revenue and growth metrics Demonstrating impressive revenue growth, job creation, or market need can also strengthen your case. ‍ 5. Industry impact Showcase how your startup has made a notable impact on your industry or field. Keep in mind the O-1 visa duration. The O-1 visa typically comes with a three-year initial period, with the possibility of an extension. This can provide startup founders with a good amount of time to establish their business in the U.S. and seek additional funding and growth. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Given the unique nature of startup founder cases, it&#x27;s highly advisable to consult with an experienced immigration provider that specializes in O-1 visas. We can help you navigate the process, assess your eligibility, and guide you in compiling a compelling application. Get in contact with us here .

These two are popular choices for immigrants seeking to make a name for themselves in various fields, from the arts to business. Since these visas are very similar, it can be confusing to determine which one is best for you. Let&#x27;s dive into the details of these two visas, what sets them apart, and how their approval thresholds differ. What is the O1 Visa? The O-1A visa, often referred to as the ""genius visa,"" is a visa category that is frequently misinterpreted. Despite the common belief that it is exclusively for celebrities, athletes, or Nobel Prize winners, that’s not always the case. Many people can be eligible for the O-1 visa due to their exceptional talents in fields like science, technology, and business, including startup founders, researchers, and artists. Check out this article for more details on the O-1 visa. To qualify for an O1 visa, you need to demonstrate a record of outstanding achievements and recognition. This could include awards, critical acclaim, and/or a substantial body of work. Letters of recommendation from industry experts are also crucial to prove your reputation in your field. What is the EB1 Visa? The EB1 visa is part of the Employment-Based (EB) category of visas. It&#x27;s specifically aimed at individuals with extraordinary abilities in their field, including outstanding professors, researchers, managers, executives, and more. The EB1 has 10 critiera, of which 8 are the same as the O-1, however the standard for the EB1 is significantly higher as a it a path to permanent residency. Key Differences Between O1 and EB1 Visas O1 Visa Non-immigrant visa, temporary. Focuses on individuals with extraordinary abilities or achievements. Typically issued for up to three years, with extensions possible. Requires substantial evidence of extraordinary abilities, including awards, recognition, and letters of recommendation. Press is usually less important for O1 than the EB1 The O1 visa often accepts startup founders in an accelerator program with proper documentation Easier to obtain compared to EB1, but still requires a strong case. Accepts ""future"" high salary Option to apply via an agent instead of an employer. EB1 Visa Immigrant visa, leading to permanent residency. For individuals with extraordinary abilities, educational expertise, and multinational managers or executives. Grants permanent residency, but initially is a two-year conditional green card. Requires extensive documentation to prove sustained national or international acclaim. Press is usually important Does not accept “future” high salary or business accelerator programs. Has higher approval standards due to its immigrant nature. The key distinction between the O1 and EB1 visas is their approval thresholds. While both require considerable evidence of extraordinary abilities, the EB1 visa sets the bar significantly higher. This is because the EB1 visa is a path to permanent residency, and the U.S. government wants to ensure that those granted this visa truly stand out in their fields and will contribute to society for the long haul. In summary, if you&#x27;re on your way to becoming a global superstar in your field, the O1 visa might be your stepping stone to the U.S. However, if you&#x27;ve already reached the pinnacle of your career, the EB1 visa is your golden ticket to permanent residency. Remember, the key to a successful visa application is having a strong case supported by compelling evidence. Whether you&#x27;re pursuing the O1 or EB1 visa, both offer unique opportunities to advance your career and make your mark in the United States. Your journey may start with an extraordinary achievement, but with dedication and perseverance, you can turn it into a lasting legacy.

If you’re interested in coming to the United States for a short period to work, study, or research, the J-1 Visa might be for you. Known as the Exchange Visitor nonimmigrant visa, the main purpose of the J-1 is to facilitate educational and cultural exchanges. What sets the J-1 apart from other visas is its emphasis on cultural exchange, allowing participants to immerse themselves in American culture and share their own cultural perspectives. We’ve compiled everything you need to know about the J-1 visa so you can feel comfortable applying for your adventure in the United States. Who is eligible for a J-1 visa? Individuals are eligible for a J-1 visa if they’ve been accepted into a specific exchange program sponsored by an organization that has been designated as a J-1 visa program sponsor by the U.S. Department of State. Depending on the specific program, participants may need to demonstrate a certain level of education or professional experience relevant to the program category. What type of work can you do on the J-1 visa? One of the best things about the J-1 visa is its versatility. It covers various program categories, including: Trainee: Similar to interns, but for individuals with more work experience. Research Scholar: Participants engage in research activities. Teacher: Participants teach or conduct research at an accredited educational institution. Student Intern: Participants engage in practical training in their field of study. Summer Work Travel: Students can work and travel in the U.S. during their summer break. Au Pair: Childcare providers live with host families. Do you need a sponsor for the J-1 Visa? People applying for a J-1 visa must be sponsored by an approved exchange program that is designated by the U.S. Department of State. The sponsor is responsible for overseeing the program and ensuring compliance with regulations. How long can you stay in the U.S. on a J-1 Visa? The length of stay on a J-1 visa depends on the specific program category. For example, interns and trainees may stay for up to 12 or 18 months, while summer work travel participants typically stay for a few months. The J-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa, meaning it does not lead directly to permanent residency in the United States. Two-Year Home Residency Requirement ‍ Some J-1 visa holders may be subject to a two-year home residency requirement, which means they must return to their home country or country of last permanent residence for at least two years before being eligible for certain other U.S. visas . Whether you&#x27;re looking to enhance your professional skills, dive into academia, or simply embark on an incredible adventure, the J-1 visa could be your opportunity to live and work in the United States temporarily. If you have any questions about the J-1 visa, please contact us and we’ll help guide you through the process.

This visa opens doors for those with extraordinary talents and expertise. To make sure you&#x27;re on the right track and applying for the best visa for you, it&#x27;s essential to prove that your income is as impressive as your abilities. Don&#x27;t worry; it might seem like a lot, but let’s break it down. ‍ What’s the deal with high remuneration? According to the US Citizenship & Immigration Services website , “the O-1 nonimmigrant visa is for the individual who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, and has been recognized nationally or internationally for those achievements.” This specific visa is known for its strict requirements, one of which is the high remuneration part. This requirement is simply asking for proof of your financial success and proving that you&#x27;re rightfully earning more than the average person in your field. Here’s what you’re going to need to prove it. 1. Find benchmarks to prove your financial success. You’ll first want to check out the current landscape of your industry. In O-1A terms, this means finding out what others in your field usually earn. What is the going rate for your role, in your specific area of expertise? This helps prove that, as Anchorman once put it, you’re “kind of a big deal”. Here are some resources you can use to figure out the going rates for your specific area of expertise: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides comprehensive data on wages, salaries, and employment trends in various industries and occupations in the United States. Their search tool makes it easy to find statistics related to your specific field or even geographic area. Websites like Glassdoor , Indeed , PayScale , and Salary.com compile salary information from employees who voluntarily share their pay details. These platforms often provide average salary ranges for specific job titles and industries. Many industries have professional associations that publish reports and surveys on salary trends and compensation packages for their members. Check to see if your field has a relevant association and figure out how to access their resources. Look for market research reports related to your industry. These reports often include data on compensation and salary ranges. If you&#x27;re already in the process of securing a job in the U.S., the employment offer itself will be a primary source of information regarding your expected income. Basically, the U.S. government wants to see that you are a valuable employee who will exceed the earning expectations of your field. 2. Show me the money, literally. Now, let&#x27;s talk paperwork. Gather those documents that tell the story of your financial success. Think tax returns, pay stubs, and employment contracts – all of them prove how much money you make for this exceptional skill that you have. One important thing to remember is that if you are applying for the O-1A visa, you’ll need a job offer already in the U.S. You should include your employment contract that shows your compensation is higher than the average individual in your field. (You’ve already one this research in step 1.) 3. Get those glowing reviews in writing. Chances are, if you’re a standout individual in your field of work, you’ve gotten some good feedback from trusted peers and industry leaders. If you haven’t already, get that feedback in writing. You can ask colleagues, employers, or a client who knows you well to write a letter confirming your expertise, and that your earnings back it up. 4. Flex those awards. Don’t be shy when it comes to showcasing your expertise. Maybe you’ve earned some awards or honors in your field. Maybe you’ve published work of major significance in your field. Providing proof of these is an excellent way to highlight that you are well-respected and get paid accordingly for your work. 5. Consistency is key. It&#x27;s not about one big paycheck; it&#x27;s about the journey. Your income should consistently prove that you&#x27;re the go-to expert in your field, so make sure that you’re showing consistently high income. Tips for Meeting the O-1A Visa High Remuneration Requirement Negotiate like a boss. When you&#x27;re locking in a new job in the U.S., don&#x27;t be shy about negotiating your salary. Aim high – like, really high. You deserve it! Show the full picture. Sometimes, money flows in from various sources like consulting gigs, speaking engagements, royalties, or client work of various kinds. Be sure to document all of these income streams. It paints a full picture of your financial success. Keep meticulous records. Think of it as showcasing your financial portfolio – income, expenses, and all of your financial moves. It&#x27;ll make your application super clear and easy to follow, plus it will make your life a million times easier. Build an A+ application. Don&#x27;t forget the other parts of your O-1A visa application. Get those recommendation letters, awards, publications, and anything else that says, ""I&#x27;m not just good; I&#x27;m the best!"" This is not the time to be humble, but rather, to showcase that you the proven and trusted expert in your field. The high remuneration requirement isn’t always as intimidating as it seems. Chances are, if you’re at the point where you’re applying for the O-1A visa, you already have the documentation to back up your success. By confidently negotiating a top-tier salary, diversifying your income, and keeping impeccable records, you&#x27;re well on your way to meeting this requirement. Remember, each case is unique, and you don’t have to navigate U.S. immigration alone. Plymouth offers personalized application support for the world’s best talent.

This visa is designed for individuals with exceptional abilities in various fields, including science, arts, education, business, or athletics. It&#x27;s a prestigious visa category that allows you to live and work in the United States. We dive into that visa more here . Who are considered dependents? Dependents, within the context of the O1 visa, usually refer to your spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21. If you have a spouse or children, they are the ones we&#x27;re talking about. The good news is that you can bring your dependents along with you on your O1 visa journey. They will typically be granted O3 visas, which are specifically intended for the immediate family members of O1 visa holders. O3 visas are generally granted for the same duration as your O1 visa. For instance, if your O1 visa is valid for the standard three years, your dependents&#x27; O3 visas will also be valid for those three years. Eligibility for Dependents The eligibility criteria for O3 visa holders are pretty straightforward. Your spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 automatically qualify for the O3 visa if you’ve already being considered for the O1. There&#x27;s no need for them to prove any extraordinary abilities or achievements, unlike the primary O1 visa holder. To apply for O3 visas, you will need the following documents: Passport for each dependent A copy of your O1 visa approval notice Evidence of the family relationship (marriage certificate for your spouse, birth certificates for your children) A step-by-step guide to the application process Include them in your O1 application. When applying for your O1 visa, you can simultaneously file for your dependents&#x27; O3 visas. It&#x27;s an efficient way to streamline the process. Your dependents will typically need to attend an interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate in your home country, just like you did for the O1 visa. Processing times can vary, so it&#x27;s advisable to check with the respective embassy or consulate for precise information. You can usually schedule your interviews at the same time. Working on O3 Visas It&#x27;s important to note that O3 visa holders are not automatically authorized to work in the United States. If your spouse or children want to work or study in the United States, they will need to apply for separate work or student visas. So yes, you can indeed bring your dependents on your O1 visa journey, and the process is relatively easy. Your exceptional abilities have opened doors to exciting opportunities, and now, your loved ones can be a part of this incredible journey with you. If you need more help navigating your O1 or O3 visas, we’re here for you. Plymouth Street will make sure you’re fully prepared for the application process and show you every step of the way.

It&#x27;s an incredible accomplishment, but there&#x27;s one more crucial step to take before you can embark on your journey: scheduling a visa appointment. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll guide you through the process of booking your visa appointment, step by step, making it simple and stress-free. Before we delve into the nitty-gritty of scheduling your visa appointment, let&#x27;s understand why it&#x27;s essential. The O1-A visa is designed for individuals with extraordinary abilities or achievements in various fields and allows you to work legally in the United States. The visa appointment, conducted at U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide, is the final step to demonstrate your eligibility for the O1-A visa. Preparing for Your Visa Appointment Successful visa appointments require preparation. The process of scheduling your visa appointment can vary depending on your location, but here&#x27;s a general overview of the steps involved. 1. Gather your documents. Collect all the necessary documents, including your valid passport, visa approval notice (Form I-797), DS-160 confirmation page, a passport-sized photo, and any additional documents requested by the U.S. embassy or consulate. You will need printed copies of all of this information, so ensure you have all of them in a folder ready to go for your interview. 2. Visit the Official U.S. Visa Information and Appointment Services Website. Most countries have an official website for visa appointment scheduling. For example, if you&#x27;re applying in Australia, visit the U.S. Visa Information and Appointment Services website for Australia. A quick Google search will help you find the correct website, but always make sure it’s an official site ending in .gov. 3. Create or log into your account. You&#x27;ll need to create an account or log in if you have an existing one. Double-check that you’ve provided accurate information since this will be used for all communications regarding your appointment. You don’t want to miss important communications because you misspelled your email address. 4. Complete the DS-160 Form. If you haven&#x27;t already, fill out the DS-160 form and save the confirmation page. This form gathers your personal information and trip details to the USA. Information from this completed form will be required during the appointment scheduling process. 5. Pay the visa application fee. Check the visa application fee for your specific category and make the payment through the official website. Keep the payment receipt as proof for your interview. 6. Schedule your appointment. Follow the instructions on the website to schedule your visa appointment. You&#x27;ll need to enter the barcode from your DS-160 confirmation page and the receipt number from your fee payment. Select the U.S. embassy or consulate where you want to have your interview, choose a date and time that works for you, and confirm your appointment. 7. Attend the visa interview. On the day of your interview, make sure to arrive at the U.S. embassy or consulate with plenty of time to spare. You&#x27;ll be required to present your documents and respond to questions regarding your O1-A visa application. ‍ Tips for a Successful Visa Appointment In addition to the steps mentioned above, here are some tips for crushing the visa appointment. 1. Dress professionally. Dressing professionally shows your professionalism, respect for the process, and can leave a positive impression on the consular officer. 2. Be punctual. Arriving late can negatively impact your interview, so plan to arrive well in advance of your appointment time and give yourself some wiggle room for traffic, public transit mishaps, or any other event that could stand in the way of making it on time. 3. Be honest and transparent. Always provide honest and direct answers to the consular officer&#x27;s questions. If you&#x27;re unsure about something, it&#x27;s totally fine to admit it. 4. If you have additional documents such as letters of recommendation, awards, or publications, bring copies of them along to strengthen your application. 5. Prepare for questions. Expect questions related to your qualifications and achievements. Be ready to discuss your work and its significance in your field. This is the time to really showcase why you go above and beyond in your industry, and why you deserve a chance to showcase those skills in the United States. 6. Keep calm and stay positive. Nervousness is totally normal, but try to remain calm and composed during the interview. Project confidence in your abilities, even if you are super nervous in the moment. 7. Before the interview, revisit your visa application and the information provided in your DS-160 form. Being familiar with all the details of your application can help you answer questions confidently. ‍ After Your Visa Appointment Following your interview, the consular officer will provide you with the outcome. If your visa is approved, congratulations! You&#x27;ll receive a visa stamp on your passport, granting you legal entry to the United States. If, however, your visa application is denied, don&#x27;t lose hope. You can politely ask about the reason for the denial and, where possible, address the issues before reapplying. Keep in mind that the O1-A visa is highly competitive, and many applicants may need to make multiple attempts to secure it. Plymouth Street is not a law firm.

If you’re applying for the O1 visa, you’ve probably heard about the O1 agent. Agents are commonly used in the entertainment industry and are becoming more common in business and technology as well. An agent petitions on behalf of the visa applicant instead of an employer, allowing the applicant to take on multiple roles or projects in the United States. This post will outline what an agent does, and what to know about using one. Why use an O1 Agent? In the context of the O1 visa, an agent is preferred when the visa applicant wants to pursue multiple employment engagements at the same time.This is common in industries where employment opportunities, such as technology, acting, music, consulting, or sports, come up intermittently or short-term. Rather than having multiple employers filing O1 petitions for you, an agent can petition on behalf of you and multiple employers. An agent can be used instead of an employer to petition for the applicant during the visa process. This allows the applicant to take on multiple projects while in the United States. You can add employers once the O1 has been approved, but you’ll need to update your agent with any additional employment contracts. What does an O1 Agent do? The primary role of an O1 agent is to represent and assist the O1 visa applicant in employment and related opportunities in the United States. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of their key responsibilities: O1 agents act as a petitioner on your behalf and can be used instead of an employer. They ensure all employment arrangements adhere to U.S. immigration laws and regulations, including the high remuneration requirement of the O1 visa. What is the process for submitting an O1 visa with an agent as petitioner? The agent must have a contract with the visa applicant outlining the fees. This can be a one-time fee, percentage of profit, or other arrangement. An agent doesn’t necessarily have to receive payment, but you must have a written agreement. Each employer needs to sign a short, written agreement stating “I authorize [agent] to act in the [employer’s] place as an agent for the limited purpose of filing this petition.” You will need to submit information about your employer, terms of work, and the length of the contract. It is helpful to have a contract for a long time so that you can request the full three years of the O1 visa. The US immigration office tends to grant O1 visas based on the length of the contracts attached to the application. Exception for certain industries It&#x27;s important to note that not all O1 visa applicants require an agent. For individuals with a specific job offer or ongoing employment, the relationship with the employer may serve as a substitute for an agent. Understanding the nuances of the O1 agent&#x27;s role is essential for a successful O1 visa application. If you&#x27;re in an industry where an agent is helpful, be sure to collaborate with a trustworthy and experienced one to navigate the process smoothly. We&#x27;re expanding access for business and technology professionals to use the O1 agent route. Get in contact with us here .

The visa journey isn’t clear cut or straightforward. I received a lot of conflicting advice and ended up spending 100+ hours researching different options and preparing my application. I hope this helps demystify the process and saves others’ time. O-1 visa applicants must demonstrate extraordinary ability in their field. This is a high standard, so O-1 visas are not usually the first option to consider for people looking to move to the US. But for those with significant, documented experience or academic credentials, the O-1 is worth considering. I’ll highlight the benefits of the O-1 vs the H-1B. After working for years in technology and startups, I believe immigrant entrepreneurs have a unique ability to overcome difficulties, bringing fresh and diverse perspectives to the startup space. This post is to help others understand what an O-1 visa is and figure out whether it’s the right or them. About me: I’m a British citizen and I moved to the US in August 2019 from Berlin. I wanted to move to San Francisco because I thought it would be a great place to meet ambitious smart people working on hard problems (I like working intensely on important things!). I’m very happy here now (as pictured!). Disclaimer: I’m not a lawyer! I also applied under the Trump Administration and there may be new visa options in the next few years. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on Twitter @lisawehden . I was inspired by Harshita’s guide (which is great and you should also check it out). What’s covered: What is an O-1 visa? O-1 vs H-1B How to apply Recommendation Letters Processing times and fees RFEs What is an O-1 visa? According to the Citizenship and Immigration Services agency at the US Department of Homeland Security, the O-1 visa applies to any individual: “ who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics (the O1-A) or who has a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry and has been recognized nationally or internationally for those achievements (the O1-B) .” O-1 visas are initially granted for up to three years. After that they can be extended for one year at a time and there’s no limit on the number of extensions. There are two types of O-1 visas, the O1-A and the O1-B. In this post I’ll focus on the O1-A as it’s for those applying for extraordinary ability in business which is more common for individuals working in the technology sector. What are the benefits? There’s many advantages to the O-1: There is no annual quota on the number of visas that can be issued (H1Bs only have a quota for the initial visa; there is no quota for renewals) The processing time is typically faster than for the H-1B O-1 status is far less likely to be subject to political controversies (and adverse changes in visa rules) There is no ultimate limit on how long you can stay in the US — after your first visa status expires, you can keep extending your status indefinitely in one-year increments (However you can stay on H1-B in the US past 6 years if you have a pending green card petition. H1-Bs are issued in 3-year increments, so you could indefinitely renew for 3-year increments until you’re eligible for a green card) Additionally similarly to the H1-B: The O-1 visa is considered a “dual intent” visa, which means that you can transition to permanent residency without returning home first, as long as you meet the requirements for permanent residency under whichever status you are seeking (EB-1, for example, which I’ll discuss later). O-1 visa holders can change employers while in the United States, without having to return home. The difficulty is providing the necessary documentation to demonstrate to US immigration officials that you possess extraordinary ability. What does “extraordinary ability” mean? The phrase “extraordinary ability” means a level of expertise that the applicant is one of a small percentage of people who has risen to the very top of their field of endeavour. If you’re applying for an O-1A in business, you will have to specify which subsection of business you’re an expert in (e.g., emerging startup technologies, developer technologies etc). One of the reasons for this is that the term “extraordinary ability” is inherently subjective, subject to the discretion of the USCIS examiner. This means you have to build a clear narrative argument around why you’re extraordinary and provide ample evidence. Think of this like a story about your career and achievements. How do you apply? If you want to apply for an O-1 visa, you can’t file the application yourself. Instead you need: a sponsor (an employer) who can file the application on your behalf. if you want to work on your own startup or other independent work, you’ll need to form an LLC or C Corp. I didn’t try this method but the O-1 requires you to own 49% equity in the sponsor company or have an odd number of directors on your board so you can be fired. You’ll need to submit a business plan as part of your application. If you are in the US on other lawful status, then along with the I-129 form, you will need to file a change of status form requesting to change your status from your current temporary visa to an O status. For people on an OPT, F1 or J1, it is possible to change to an O-1 — there’s SO many myths that you can’t switch and that’s a not true. However it is harder to prove extraordinary status if you’re moving from one of these visas. If you are outside of the US, once your I-129 visa petition is approved, the next step is to obtain an O visa from the US consulate in your country. You’ll need: A copy of your contract with your employer You don’t need the original copy, and USCIS (apparently!) will accept an oral contract as long as your provide them a summary of the essential terms 2. A copy of your previous stays in the US 3. Evidence of your extraordinary ability To document proof of extraordinary ability, your application will need to include evidence that meet three of the following eight criteria : Nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards in your field. Membership in professional or occupational associations for which membership requires outstanding achievement (something equivalent to the National Academy of Sciences, for example) as judged by experts in the field.. Publications in professional journals or distinguished trade publications or other major media about you and your work. Original and significant scientific, scholarly, or commercial contributions to your field. Scholarly articles in your field published in professional journals. A high level of compensation (salary or other remuneration). Participation as a judge in evaluating the work of other participants in your field or a similar field. Employment in an essential role for organizations with distinguished reputations. Some examples of evidence could include being accepted into a prestigious accelerator (YC or 500 startups), having articles published in major media (such as TechCrunch) or participating in panels or judging others’ work. If you want to improve your chances, try and speak at tech conferences, events, apply to hackathons, write articles etc. I spent at least 50+ hours collecting evidence — emails, videos, articles, degrees etc. This part takes the longest time so try and be organized (set up a google folder with all your evidence). The advisory opinion letter: The advisory opinion letter is a written advisory opinion on your extraordinary ability from experts in your field (basically a letter of recommendation). You’ll need to get between 8–10 letters from high status people working in the technology industry who vouch for your extraordinary ability. The letters can be a combination of people who have worked directly with you and people who know about your work but haven’t work with you. Forms: Your sponsor must complete and sign Form I-129, Petition for Non-Immigrant Worker and related I-129 O supplement (your attorney will help you with this but you’ll have to ask your employer to sign several forms) Include all supporting documentation of your extraordinary ability (you’ll need to include copies of every piece of evidence — copies of your degree, relevant articles, prizes etc). Prepare the filing fee of $460 in the form of a business or personal check, money order or cashier’s check, payable to “Department of Homeland Security.” Send the application package to the appropriate USCIS Service Center . The USCIS will send a Receipt Notice. This confirms that USCIS received the application. The entire application can range from 400–900 pages (you’re require to include physical copies of every piece of evidence you reference in your application). Processing times and fees: The processing time for an O-1 application is considerably shorter than processing times for most other types of visas. In most cases, processing is completed within two or three months. Current processing times can be found here . - The current USCIS filing fee is $460. - You can also use the USCIS Premium Processing Service by filing Form I-907 . This will shorten processing time to only 15 days, but it will cost you $2,500 in processing fees. Different immigration providers quote various fees. RFEs: USCIS may issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) at some point during processing. The RFE is basically USCIS asking for more information / evidence to prove your extraordinary ability. Last year, apparently 50% of all applications received an RFE. If you receive an RFE don’t panic. You will need to respond with the evidence required by USCIS to process your application. USCIS will issue a written notice of its decision (approval or denial). If the application is approved, USCIS will send an I-797 approval notice. This is a critical document, so don’t lose it. What happens if there are changes in O-1 employment? You’ll have to file an amendment if there are material changes to your employment (e.g., if you change your job, move from part-time to full-time etc). What’s next after the O-1? You can apply for the EB-1 (green card) which is the exact same criteria for the O-1 but the bar for evidence is harder. You can self-sponsor the EB-1 (so you don’t need an employer). Finally GOOD LUCK. It’s a hard emotionally draining process applying for a visa and there’s a lot of uncertainty. Keep focused and feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

May 7, 2023 The O-1A visa, often referred to as the ""genius visa,"" is a visa category that is frequently misinterpreted. Despite the common belief that it is exclusively for celebrities, athletes, or Nobel Prize winners, that’s not the case. Numerous individuals are eligible for the O-1 visa due to their exceptional talents in fields like science, technology, and business, including startup founders, researchers, and artists. In this article, we will delve into each of the O-1 visa requirements. How is the O-1A different from the O-1B? The O-1A is for individuals with exceptional ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics, whereas the O-1B is for individuals with an extraordinary ability in the arts or the motion picture or television industries. Qualifications for applying for O-1A How many criteria do I need to meet to qualify for the O-1A? You must either have received a major, internationally recognized award or meet at least three of the criteria below: Member of an association in the field that requires outstanding achievements; There are published material in professional or major media about you; You have judged the work of others in the field; You have made original contributions of major significance; You have written scholarly articles in professional journals or other major media; You have been employed in a critical or essential capacity for organizations of distinguished reputation; and You have received a high salary or other remuneration.
