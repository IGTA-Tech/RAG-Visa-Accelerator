A: I had previously worked with a lawyer—we were going through both the H-1B and O-1 with him. We were also managing visas for our construction workers. I had already gone through the whole process of compiling the documents and sending them to the lawyers, responding to everything they asked for. But lawyers usually just say, “We need these 10 things,” and that’s it. So I organized everything, labeled which documents were for which categories, and sent it all over. “Then, one week before the application, they said 90% of the documents were missing—when in fact, we had already submitted them.” Their document control was really poor. This was the company’s lawyer—they had already applied for the same visa previously, so they should have had all the original information. We just updated it. Still, the process was incredibly stressful. I was spending more time managing people’s visa applications than doing my actual job. On top of that, we had someone else applying for a TN visa—which is much simpler. We sent everything to the lawyers three months before the visa interview. Then, just three or four days before the interview, they said, “This is all wrong. It doesn’t work. We need a letter, and it has to follow this format.” I thought, what have you been doing all this time? That’s when I realized they probably weren’t the right fit for my own O-1 visa. Especially knowing what the O-1 requires—there’s so much emphasis on the evidence you submit. It’s not just about having someone sponsor you, but showing that you’re truly qualified. Thankfully, it was all thanks to Ramiro and the Tukki team. Tukki’s lawyers were amazing. It was a really smooth process. I even told Ramiro that even if I hadn’t gotten the visa, it wouldn’t have been because of the team—they did everything they possibly could. If anything, it would’ve meant my evidence wasn’t strong enough. But overall, I think their help made a huge difference. Q: Could you apply alone for a US visa such as the O-1? A: You can&#x27;t. There’s no way you can do it on your own. There’s no template—nothing. I think the F-1, the student visa, was the only one you could technically apply for without a lawyer. But even that was a mess. The system is so archaic: you apply for your F-1 visa and pay for it online, and before you go to the interview, you have to double-check everything. “I was lucky—I checked all the required documents and realized there was an additional payment needed. So, even though you’ve already paid for your visa in your mind, there’s also a DS-160 fee.” I knew people who showed up to their visa appointment and got rejected just because they hadn’t made that payment. And the problem is it’s only mentioned in one line somewhere. You have to go to an entirely different website, from a totally different department, make that payment, and bring proof with you to the appointment. It’s like—why can’t they just have everything in one place? Q: Good news on O-1 visa application to US immigration A: Ramiro just messaged me and said, “Hey, do you have a minute? Can we have a quick call?” And I was like, “Sure.” I thought maybe he needed some additional documents or something, so I just jumped on Zoom. Then he goes, “Oh, I just called to tell you that you got your O-1 visa.” I was a little taken aback—definitely wasn’t expecting that news so soon.

A: For me, the process felt quick—mainly because I didn’t have to figure out a lot on my own. From the beginning, I had access to the platform, which made everything much easier. I could clearly understand what was expected from me: what I needed to do, what to fill out, and how things were progressing. “I didn’t have to overthink anything—the platform really helped by showing me how the process was going to unfold, who was reviewing what, and how many days each step was taking.” Q: Was there anything you thought would be challenging, but turned out differently? A: I think what usually takes most people the longest is just figuring things out—like what they need to do, what the next step is, or who they should talk to. “Even with the expert letters, I just shared a list of potential experts, and then Ramiro sat down with me and said, ‘Okay, we’ll do this, this, and this.’“ Q: How was your experience with customer service/client support? A: In terms of customer service, it was very fast and efficient. Sometimes, within just a couple of hours—if not minutes—I’d get a response. Ramiro would often reply almost immediately. “Whenever I felt a little lost, there was always someone ready to support me.” Q: After completing the O-1A with Tukki, why are you choosing to use it again for your EB-1A and to manage your team’s visa processes?

Originally from Galicia, Spain, he built his career at McKinsey & Company before launching his own startup in Mexico City — where he now leads one of the fastest-growing insurance carriers in the country. He recently obtained his EB-1A visa with Tukki. Q: When did you decide to start your U.S. visa process, and how did you find Tukki? L: I was introduced to Ramiro, Tukki’s founder, by a colleague of mine at McKinsey. He explained that, based on the achievements so far and the merits of the venture, we could qualify for the EB-1A. One of my closest friends — also a founder — had gone through the process with Tukki and was super happy with the support. So I decided to take my chances. I do see a near future where I’d like to move to the U.S. “He explained the possibility of qualifying for the EB-1A based on our achievements and the merits of the venture.” — Lois Q: What were your main concerns about the process before applying? L: Basically, it was lack of knowledge. I didn’t know this path was possible — to get directly the green card based on extraordinary ability. I didn’t know if my case was strong enough to qualify. But Ramiro and the team had great communication and explained everything very well — all the KPIs and checks you need to qualify — and gave me the confidence that my case was strong enough to have a good chance of approval. Q: How was your experience working with the Tukki team and the platform? L: When I started, the platform had just been launched, so I saw it evolve. It was really well built, self-explanatory, and the actions felt very natural. Whenever I needed help from the team — to review a specific part of the case, a translation, or anything — it was easy to interact. We had a WhatsApp group, and they were super responsive. Both the product and the service level that the team provided were top-notch. “Both the product — the tech product itself — and the service level that the team provided were top-notch.” — Lois Check our EB-1A visa guide to learn more about it Q: How did you feel when you got the EB-1A visa approval? L: I was quite surprised — to be honest — but for good. You always hope for the best, but nothing is guaranteed. When they contacted me and told me it was approved, I was very excited about the opportunity to move in the future to the U.S. It basically opens a great option — a life in the U.S. that previously wasn’t there — so it’s definitely a life-changing event. Q: What would you tell other founders looking for visa providers? L: I’d say track record is relevant — and talk to people who have gone through the same path. Support and responsiveness make all the difference. For most people, this is not your core task — you have your company, your family, your life. So it’s key to have all the support possible and a team that’s there when you need them. “Track record and responsiveness make all the difference.” — Lois Watch our EB-1A visa course More people who made it with Tukki See all O-1A Akrisht Pandey 🇮🇳 India | Director of Real Estate Krea USA I got my O-1 visa approved thanks to the team at Tukki and their lawyers were amazing, a really good process.

A: First, do your due diligence—understand which visa is the right fit for you. Second, get clear on the requirements. Third, of course, consider your budget. And fourth, make sure you find the right team—the people you work with should give you peace of mind that they’re truly doing their best. “Because at the end of the day, you want to reach your goal—not spend a year on something that could take two months.” Q: What did you most like about processing your O-1A visa with Tukki? A: From the very beginning, I felt it was a highly personalized experience. Ramiro, Tukki’s CEO, was very transparent about my visa options and the different types Tukki handles. We also had a conversation with one of Tukki’s lawyers, which helped clarify everything. “I think that level of personalization is Tukki’s standout trait—and it’s something many traditional law firms tend to lack.” Q: Can you describe your interaction with the Tukki lawyers? A: Tukki’s paralegal and legal team gave me all the tools, time, and personalized attention they could. I had one- to two-hour calls with Ramiro where we reviewed documents, worked on the letters, and refined them together. “I felt that regardless of the outcome, they did everything within their reach.” The result would ultimately depend on the strength of the materials I provided, which they used to build and reinforce a solid case. Q: What was your favorite part of the Tukki experience? A: Even if you have an amazing lawyer—and here you do have an amazing team of lawyers, paralegals, and all the people working behind the scenes—they’re all working for you, in a way. “All of that, for the same price a regular lawyer might charge—which is really impressive.” More people who made it with Tukki See all O-1A Akrisht Pandey 🇮🇳 India | Director of Real Estate Krea USA I got my O-1 visa approved thanks to the team at Tukki and their lawyers were amazing, a really good process.

A: I think there are a couple of things that stand out versus other firms. So one. This sounds really obvious, but no other firm that I’ve worked with, or that my co-founders have worked with get like, set up the email notifications. So it usually takes them like a week or 5 days to give me an update where, if they would have set up the email notifications, they get it immediately. And I know Tukki, you guys always shared the updates with me immediately. I also really appreciated the transparency. I know, from like my experience working with other firms, and in general, other people’s experience working with other firms. Sometimes, they get, I don’t know, “Hey? There was a mistake in this document. You need to resubmit it, and the firms don’t tell you; they just go and do it, and you’re never notified.” So I feel like Tukki is also really, really transparent with, like where we are in the process, what’s happening? What can happen? And I really appreciated that. And then the other. The last thing is communication. So I feel like Tukki is really good at like we received this. This is what’s coming next. This is what you can expect versus going silent, which is what I feel like a lot of other immigration firms like, you know, they’re doing their job, but they don’t communicate well, so I had a really good experience, and I think those are like 3 things that stood out to me a lot versus other firms. “I feel like [Tukki] is really, really transparent with where we are in the process, what’s happening, what can happen… And then the other [thing] is communication… you guys always shared the updates with me immediately versus going silent, which is what I feel like a lot of other immigration firms do.” Q: What was your experience with the platform and how did you feel about the speed of the process? A: I think it was really easy to use intuitive. I think it’s really helpful that you guys have, like all the like tips and tricks and examples of what this should be filled out like. I think that was really helpful. I logged in a lot to see the progress, and the team moved really fast. “I really felt like every single person on the team… everything that I was asking, or everything that they were doing, was like their top priority. And it’s so amazing to feel that support for something so important as immigration.” Q: How would you summarize your experience with Tukki? A: So I really felt like every single person on the team that I was working with, like everything that I was asking, or everything that they were doing, was like their top priority. And it’s just so comforting.

Samuel has an idea... The full story of Samuel 3 min Q: Before you found Tukki, how was your US immigration experience? A: The first approach I took was to hire a private lawyer who specialized in immigration. It was a horrible experience. The problem was that I didn’t know much about the process, so when I reached out to lawyers to help me, their answer was: “Sure, my hourly rate is $250. If you want to understand what I do, you need to pay for one hour.” “I didn’t even know what I needed yet, and I was already being charged.” Still, I paid the $250. Then this person came to the meeting and spent the first 25–30 minutes on introductions and small talk—just wasting time. I didn’t want to be rude, but I was thinking, “I’m paying a lot for this hour—I need real answers.” In the end, I didn’t get the full information I needed. After the meeting, they sent me a list of visa options, but if I wanted to go deeper into any of them, I had to pay for more hours and additional fees. And everything moved really slowly. Q: What made you decide that the EB-1A was better for you than the O-1A? A: It’s not that the EB-1A is better—it’s that they serve different purposes. The O-1 is a nonimmigrant visa. For example, I’m married, and while I can live and work in the U.S. with the O-1, have a Social Security Number and all of that—my wife, on an O-3, doesn’t get the same benefits. She doesn’t have a Social Security Number and can’t work. That’s a big limitation. Also, the O-1 is temporary. It’s valid for three years. Yes, you can extend it—possibly up to nine years by reapplying—but you’re never going to become a U.S. resident on an O-1. So if you&#x27;re thinking long-term and actually want to settle in the U.S., the O-1 is not the right visa. Q: Did you include everything you could? A: For the application, you’re expected to include details like relevant past jobs, income, press coverage, and so on. In my case, I tried to include everything—like articles, publications, even jobs I thought were important. But the team reviewed it and said things like: “Don’t include that job, it’s too common—it could add noise,” or “That press mention isn’t strong enough; better to leave it out.” “So yes, we included everything that truly added value—and filtered out what didn’t.” Q: Why did you trust Tukki with your U.S. visa application? A: I really liked the energy and the enthusiasm. I could tell they were well-prepared and truly had the knowledge to handle the process. “And I don’t know if you know this, but I actually decided to be their first customer. I’m Tukki’s first fan.” More people who made it with Tukki See all O-1A Akrisht Pandey 🇮🇳 India | Director of Real Estate Krea USA I got my O-1 visa approved thanks to the team at Tukki and their lawyers were amazing, a really good process.

A: At first of all, I had a much more personal relationship with the team, so I had like a chat with Ramiro. I could see him replying sometimes Saturday evening or Sunday, if something was urgent. The rest of the team was always very available. It felt like I had much more access to the people that were working on my case, which was a very positive thing. “I like that most of the work is done clearly in the platform — that was super positive.” There was no whatsoever technology involved in my first visa application, it was a very traditional process which is part of the reason why I felt it was incredibly stupid. You know the way of collecting things, the way of drafting papers, and all of that. So the experience was much better working with Tukki. Q: How was your experience with the legal team? A: That was really nice. I like it a lot. I like using the platform. I think it has, like a nice user experience. The chat was useful, you know, more like to feel support, really, than to complete the work. I like that most of the stuff is done clearly in the platform. So that was super positive. “Overall, the experience was great.

That initial encounter left a lasting impression: “My first experience with Tukki was via the Visa Match Tool. It was very intuitive, clean, and smooth,” says Guido. Uncovering an EB-1A visa opportunity When Guido began his US visa process, he didn’t expect to qualify for an EB-1A visa. “I didn’t know I would be eligible for it; that was a complete surprise. I always assumed the EB-1 was for people who’d won Nobel Prizes or Pulitzers,” he admits. No chasing lawyers Guido’s interactions with Tukki’s platform deepened his appreciation for the US immigration service. “The technology always felt polished, well thought-out, and carefully planned. You can see the Savely (Tukki’s CTO) touch in there,” he shares. The streamlined workflows have been designed to create a hassle-free user experience, with no room for errors, and Guido picked up on every detail: “Tukki’s flows make it impossible to upload information with inconsistencies, which I absolutely love,” he adds. Small details make a big impact. “I never experienced a session timeout with Tukki, and I never had to log in again unexpectedly. Those seem like small things, but they’re important.” Building trust through excellent service From the outset, Tukki’s commitment to accuracy and customer care reassured Guido. Adding to this, having Tukki’s legal team review every detail before proceeding further reassured him. “The communication was excellent. I really appreciated how quick and easy it was to reach the paralegals and lawyers. Being able to send a message and get an answer in a matter of minutes or hours helped relieve a lot of anxiety,” he reflects. Guido’s experience has set a high bar for any future legal collaborations: He told us he hopes that the next time he works with a lawyer, if it’s not Tukki, he can replicate this experience. Falling in love with his adoptive home Needless to say, this US visa hopeful hopes to stay in the US long-term now that he has completed his PhD in Computer Science. Far beyond personal gain, Guido’s goals align with contributing to the US: “This country has invested in my education. Now it’s time for me to give back to the economy,” he reflects. His plans include using his Computer Science PhD working in hardware–software co-design at Google, and completing his STEM Optional Practical Training. A seamless path to EB-1A visa success Guido’s journey with Tukki highlights the value of a well-designed platform combined with exceptional service. By leveraging Tukki’s technology and legal expertise, he not only secured his EB-1A visa but also enjoyed a smooth and reassuring process.

Originally from London, UK, she and her team relocated to Alabama to be closer to customers and partners. She obtained an O-1 visa and shares how the process—often overwhelming for founders—became clear, structured, and ultimately transformative through Tukki. Q: Why did you decide to move to the U.S.—and to Alabama in particular? V: We joined Techstars and found a great startup ecosystem here. We found customers, investors, and academic partners, and many of our customers are in the Southeast. We like working in person, we have a team here now, and it makes a big difference to build properly rather than try to work remotely. Q: What worried you most about the visa process before starting? V: It&#x27;s a big upfront cost without knowing for sure if you&#x27;ll be accepted. We put in a lot of work before applying, making sure we met at least three of the O-1 criteria. It’s a long process and not cheap, but absolutely worth it. “The O-1 visa gave our investors confidence that we could actually operate in the U.S.” Watch our free O-1A course Q: How was your experience with Tukki and its platform? V: My Techstars managing director recommended Tukki. He said a couple of other Techstars companies had used them and had good experiences, so it was a strong recommendation to follow. V: Tukki&#x27;s interface and dashboard were great—at a glance I could check progress across all the different areas. I didn’t want a standard law firm approach where the work only starts after every piece of evidence is collected. “I wanted it to be a piecemeal process so that by the time I actually completed the last bit of evidence, the rest of the application was good to go. I think it sped up the process a fair bit.” Q: How was working with Tukki&#x27;s legal team? V: The team was very responsive and clearly knew what they were doing. There was a significant team behind the scenes, including senior attorneys, and I felt like a priority. V: It also surprised me that there was such a substantial team involved—not just one person—and that included more senior attorneys who guided the case even if they were behind the scenes. “Tukki made a fairly unfamiliar process for me as a foreigner more reassuring; it was always good to have someone on the inside who knows what they’re doing.” Q: How did you feel when you found out your visa was approved? V: Oh my god, it was the biggest relief in the world. We had our interview at the U.S. Embassy in London, were told it was approved, got our passports back, and we were on a flight almost the next day. V: The uncertainty around the visa had taken up a lot of brain space for me and my co-founder. Getting it sorted freed up time and energy that we can now fully apply to building the company. Q: What would you recommend to someone choosing between a traditional law firm and a legal-tech option? V: Meet the team you&#x27;ll work with and make sure they’re responsive and willing to go the extra mile. Get a couple of clients to vouch for them. Transparent, upfront costs matter—it removes the hesitation to ask questions or send follow-ups. Having all the costs up front was really nice with Tukki—you know what it will cost, so you’re not afraid to reach out or ask questions. “My experience with Tukki in a few words: Hands-on. Transparent. High priority.” Check our complete O-1A visa guide More people who made it with Tukki See all O-1A Akrisht Pandey 🇮🇳 India | Director of Real Estate Krea USA I got my O-1 visa approved thanks to the team at Tukki and their lawyers were amazing, a really good process.

His immigration path spanned multiple visas — from student and work permits to the O-1 — before applying for his EB-1A green card with Tukki. Q: What brought you to the U.S.? D: I moved when I was 18 to pursue my education. I studied engineering at Purdue University, worked between Boston and New York, and later completed my MBA at Harvard. My decision was driven by the opportunity to grow academically and professionally in a global environment. Q: How was your immigration journey before finding Tukki? D: I’ve been through different immigration processes for as long as I can remember — H-1Bs, F-1s, OPTs, O-1s. Each step was stressful because these cases are very important for you, but for many firms, you’re just one in hundreds of clients. It was difficult to get attention or even a reply sometimes. “It’s painful and stressful — you just want to make sure your case is strong enough to get approved.” — Daniel Q: How did you find Tukki, and what stood out from the experience? D: I learned about Tukki through referrals and positive word of mouth. From the beginning, the team was very responsive and knowledgeable. I could see exactly where my process was at any moment through their platform — upload documents, respond to comments, review feedback. That clarity made a big difference compared to other law firms I had worked with in the past. “The team was extremely responsive, supportive, and the platform made everything much easier.” — Daniel Check our EB-1A visa guide to learn more about it Q: How did you feel when your EB-1A visa was approved? D: I felt extremely relieved and satisfied. The Tukki team called me on a video call to tell me the news — everyone was there. It was a really gratifying moment, a before-and-after feeling after so many years of uncertainty. Q: What would you tell others about the visa process? D: Responsiveness and support are the most important things. For you, it’s the most important case, so you need a team that treats it that way. Tukki was always available and proactive — that made the process less stressful. “Responsiveness and support make all the difference. Tukki was always there when I needed them.” — Daniel Watch our EB-1A visa course More people who made it with Tukki See all O-1A Akrisht Pandey 🇮🇳 India | Director of Real Estate Krea USA I got my O-1 visa approved thanks to the team at Tukki and their lawyers were amazing, a really good process.

A: I saw having a software as a very clear, competitive advantage. Since I’m building a software, I know it gives a lot of transparency and a lot of efficiency into the process. What made my decision to hire you guys wasn’t only that you were very solid about everything that I needed to have, but you also had an extensive assessment of the criteria, and how you needed to present the variables and everything. Q2: How was your experience with the platform? I think the software is very thought out, and very easy to use. “The best thing is that you don’t even realize it, and you are building your petition.” And that is an advantage, because compared to other founders that I know of, they had to do all these logics on their own, and it’s quite hard to have to think through all that. So I think it’s a good guidance to have the software. Q3: How was your experience with the team? So they were very supportive. You have a lot of stress while you’re doing this because this may change a lot of things, so having this validation about why everything was going to a place was very important. I know that other lawyers maybe just ask you for things, and then they start putting the things together and that’s it, but I really appreciated the extra support that the Tukki team gave me. Q4: What advice would you give to someone choosing their immigration attorney? Hire smart people, hire people that have a strategy on how to do things, because it’s gonna make your life simpler. If you have to build on the strategy, or if the lawyers are just asking things, and you’re not seeing a clear path on what is being done, it’s going to be so much harder. “I think everything about the Tukki experience brings a lot of transparency into the problem and into the execution of the process. So that is very, very important. And I would suggest everybody to look for that, because it brings you peace into your everyday.” More people who made it with Tukki See all O-1A Akrisht Pandey 🇮🇳 India | Director of Real Estate Krea USA I got my O-1 visa approved thanks to the team at Tukki and their lawyers were amazing, a really good process.

Clifford is the co-founder of Cura, a fintech company focused on cross-border payments for small and mid-sized businesses. Anne-Marie is a medical doctor specializing in public health. Together, they navigated the O-1A visa process with Tukki’s support to relocate from Haiti to Boston. Q: Why did you decide to move to the U.S.? C: We wanted to build a better future, not only for ourselves but for the communities we could impact. Through my fintech company, Cura, we aim to improve financial access for Caribbean immigrants living in the U.S. while supporting families back home. To make that vision real, I needed to be in the U.S., where the resources and networks are available. A: The business being based in the U.S. was the main reason. For it to grow, Clifford had to be there legally. And for us, as a couple and as parents, it was also important to stay together and support him in this process. “We believed we could build a better future — for the U.S., for Haiti, and for the Caribbean community.” — Clifford Q: How did you start exploring visa options? C: I first learned from classmates at MIT who had already gone through the process. Some had applied for EB-1A or O-1A visas, so I talked with them and with several immigration lawyers to understand what to expect. One of my classmates who had worked with Tukki told us to contact their team and explain our situation, especially coming from Haiti, where things can be complicated. That’s how we got in touch with Tukki and started our journey. Q: Why did you choose Tukki, and what stood out from the experience? C: We were looking for the right support system, not just a lawyer, but a structure that could help us move efficiently and stay organized. Tukki offered that combination of expertise, technology, and guidance. A: The platform was very helpful. It gave us a clear, visual way to track where we were in the process — what we had already completed and what was still pending. Seeing that progress helped us stay organized and focus on what we needed to do next. A: I also appreciated how the team worked with us. They didn’t limit what we could present as evidence; they took time to review everything with the lawyers, explain what could or wouldn’t work, and even research additional context when needed. It was a collaborative process that made our case stronger. “Both the platform and the team worked well to give us the support we needed to get the result we wanted.” — Anne-Marie Watch our EB-1A visa course Q: How did you feel when your EB-1A visa was approved? A: We were surprised, happy, shocked, ecstatic — all of it. Because of the current situation in Haiti, we weren’t sure what to expect, so the approval brought a mix of emotions, but all positive ones. C: It really felt like a before-and-after moment. Once you know it’s approved, your whole mindset changes; you start planning how to move forward. Q: What would you tell others about the U.S. visa process and about working with Tukki? C: Don’t go through it alone. The process is complex, and you need experts who can look at your background, your skills, and your goals to choose the right path. Tukki had the lawyers, the tech system, and the follow-up that kept everything on track. You’re not just getting legal guidance; you’re also getting a tech system that reminds you what to do, helps you follow up, and keeps everything moving. That combination made a big difference for us. A: Understand what kind of support system you’ll have. Some firms are just one lawyer, others have a full team. We felt that Tukki really supported us at every step, even when things got uncertain. A: They weren’t afraid to take the risk with us, and we always felt they had our best interest in mind. “Choose a firm that will walk with you through every step.

Based in Mexico City, she has participated in international startup programs and experienced firsthand how being close to ecosystems like Silicon Valley can accelerate growth. She recently obtained her U.S. visa with Tukki. Q: How did you hear about Tukki, and what made you decide to start your visa process? V: I always dreamed about moving out of my country, but everything started last year when I began working with my startup. I joined different programs and realized Silicon Valley helps you move faster if you want to achieve certain things. A founder friend told me about Tukki and completely recommended it. That’s when I decided to start my process, and finally, I got my visa. Q: What were your biggest concerns before applying? V: You hear many success stories and think it will be easy, but when you actually look for a lawyer, the challenge is finding someone who takes your case as personally as you do. I’m not a lawyer, and there are so many details in these processes. I needed someone patient who could explain every step clearly. Before Tukki, I couldn’t find that guidance, and I was overwhelmed by so much information and so many new terms. Q: How was your experience working with the Tukki team? V: I’m completely grateful. The responses were fast — everything was very good. It wasn’t just Ramiro; the whole team had the same helpful and kind vibe. Everyone was open to help and kept me updated at every stage. Things happened quickly, and even if they were busy, they always let me know and followed up. That mindset makes a big difference. “They took the time to explain every step and gave me the peace of mind that my case was in good hands.” — Viry Check our EB-1A visa guide to learn more about it Q: How did you feel when your visa was approved? V: I was so happy! It was stressful at the beginning, but once I finished the process, I came to Mexico for my stamp and finally felt at peace. I’m happy, excited for the next steps, and my family and friends noticed that right away. This was a very important step for me — it made a big difference. “Getting the approval felt like peace — I could finally stop worrying about every detail and focus on building my company.” — Viry Q: What would you tell other founders considering this visa? V: At the beginning, one of my main concerns was budget, because this is not a cheap process — it’s an investment. Don’t focus only on price; you might find a cheaper firm, but you’ll miss other things that matter more. What really matters is having the right information and a team that customizes the service to your case. Everyone’s situation is different, so it’s important to feel they care about your process, not just another file. “It’s not just about price — it’s about having a team that adapts the process to your case and treats it like their own.” — Viry Watch our EB-1A visa course More people who made it with Tukki See all O-1A Akrisht Pandey 🇮🇳 India | Director of Real Estate Krea USA I got my O-1 visa approved thanks to the team at Tukki and their lawyers were amazing, a really good process.

H2: Simplifying US immigration with technology and empathy",about,"Tukki - About us MEET THE PEOPLE BEHIND TUKKI Simplifying US immigration with technology and empathy From personal journeys to a shared mission Tukki was born from real experience. We know firsthand how overwhelming the immigration process can be—waiting for answers, never quite knowing what’s going on with your own case. That frustration became the spark for Tukki. In 2023, after months inside this confusing process, we realized there had to be a better way. We spoke with immigrants and attorneys, looked closely at how traditional law firms handled immigration, and saw there was plenty of room for improvement—not just through technology, but also in the way people are treated throughout the process. What we really wanted was the kind of transparency and support we never found—something that should be the norm, not the exception. So we set out to build Tukki by combining the expertise of experienced immigration lawyers with the power of technology. Tukki grew from the idea that real change means blending smart tools with genuine human care and empathy. We blended the best of two worlds That’s how Tukki came to life—a team that brings together the understanding and care of experienced immigration lawyers with the clarity and speed of modern technology. Our story isn’t just about paperwork and forms; it’s about giving people real visibility, faster answers, and the confidence of knowing where they stand at every step. Tukki exists because we’ve lived this process ourselves, and we believe no one should have to go through it alone or in the dark. OUR MISSION We believe that immigration doesn&#x27;t need to be this hard THE WHAT 💡 US immigration services, made simple THE WHY ❤️ Because it shouldn’t have to be this hard THE HOW 🛠️ Tech, automation, and a dedicated legal team Who’s behind Tukki?

https://tukki.ai/faqs,Common questions about U.S. employment-based visas,"Find clear answers to common questions about U.S. employment-based visas, including O-1, EB-1, and other work visa categories.",,,faq,"Common questions about U.S. employment-based visas HELP CENTER Visa questions? We can help. Find quick answers to common US visa and immigration questions from our legal experts. Filter What is EB-1A? A visa for individuals with extraordinary ability. How much documentation do I need to file a visa petition for an EB-1A or O-1A visa? In US immigration processes, your claims must be more likely than not to be true. This means if something appears more true than false, USCIS should accept it as true. To meet this standard, the visa petitioner should provide documents that convincingly support the claim’s validity. For instance, to prove you received VC funding, you could provide signed SAFE agreements with a VC, a published article about your funding round, and documentation about the relevance of the VC. Keep in mind that theory and practice do not always perfectly align. It’s crucial you speak to an experienced legal team to avoid spending time and money on documentation that does not support your case. Is it possible to re-apply to the USCIS if your application to the O-1A or EB-1A visas is rejected? Yes, you can reapply as many times as you wish. However, bear in mind that when you submit a green card petition or it’s submitted on your behalf, immigration authorities may sometimes see this as an indication that you plan to live in the US permanently (immigrant intent). This is incompatible with a key requirement for most temporary visas, which must express an intent to relocate to the US temporarily only. If you plan to, or need to file a temporary visa application after filing an EB-1A application, this may affect your eligibility to renew or obtain your temporary visa. Rules around resubmissions are nuanced, so it is advisable to consult with an experienced immigration attorney to understand all the implications. Can my company sponsor me for an O-1A if I hold equity in it? According to recent USCIS policy, yes. In general, the agency requires a legitimate employer-employee relationship, which typically involves the ability to “hire, pay, fire, supervise, or otherwise control the work” of the beneficiary. Since this policy is new and USCIS has provided little guidance, it remains unclear how these requirements will be applied in the O-1 context. Is it wise to apply for a B-1 or B-2 business visa if you hold a C-Corporation or LLC? Holding a C-Corp or any type of business entity technically holds no implications over your legal B-1 or B-2 eligibility, but can raise questions from immigration officials in some circumstances. You could own multiple companies in the US and that generally shouldn’t affect how you apply for this visa if you’re eligible. Can the spouses of O-1 visa holders work? No. Spouses of O-1 visa holders receive an O-3 visa, which allows them to live in the U.S. but not to work. They can study, get a driver’s license, open a bank account, and travel in and out of the country freely, but employment is not permitted. What are the typical questions in the O-1 consular interview? Questions vary, but the most common is: “Tell me why you are extraordinary?” Be ready with a concise summary of your accomplishments. This is the time to confidently highlight your achievements, not to be modest. You should also be prepared to explain the details of your U.S. job—your duties, employer, compensation, and location. How long does it take to get an O-1 visa approved? With premium processing, most O-1 petitions are decided within 15 business days. Without premium processing, a decision can take several months, depending on USCIS workload. The preparation stage—collecting evidence, drafting recommendation letters, and organizing the petition—typically takes anywhere from 6 weeks to 6 months, depending on the applicant’s profile, the attorney’s approach, and how quickly supporting documents are provided. What is the difference between the O-1A and O-1B visa? The O-1A is for individuals with extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics. The O-1B is for those with extraordinary ability in the arts, or extraordinary achievement in film and television. While the two categories share similar criteria, the type of evidence required differs based on the field. In some cases, applicants may qualify under both categories—for example, a marketing professional whose work combines both business and artistic elements. Can I switch employers while on an O-1 visa? Yes. You can change employers, but in most cases the new employer must file a new petition before you can begin working with them. The only exception is for O-1B visas filed through a U.S. agent—in those cases, you may switch or add employers without needing to file a new petition. Do I need a U.S. job offer to apply for an O-1 visa? Yes. You must have either a U.S. employer or a U.S. agent who files the petition on your behalf. You cannot self-petition for the O-1. Technically, you can work for a foreign company, but the petition still needs to be filed through a U.S. agent acting as your sponsor. If you are physically in the U.S., can you work for a job abroad? Only if you hold a visa or work authorization that allows you to work in the U.S. If your status does not permit employment, you cannot legally work—even for a foreign company paying you abroad. Even with work authorization, it must cover the type of employment you intend to do. For example, an O-1 visa through a U.S. agent may allow you to work with multiple companies, while an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) provides broader flexibility. Is it the same to do a change of status within the U.S. vs getting a visa abroad? Not exactly. You can enter the U.S. in one status (e.g., tourist visa) and then request a change of status to another (e.g., O-1A). However: 1. This only changes your status inside the U.S. 2. If you leave the country, you’ll need to visit a U.S. consulate abroad to obtain a visa stamp before reentering. 3. At that consular interview, officers may question your initial intent at the time of entry. While changing status avoids an immediate trip abroad, we generally recommend consular processing from the start to avoid complications later. However, there are certain situations in which a change of status could be the best solution. Can I travel once I start my adjustment of status? Generally no, unless one of the following applies: A) You are in H-1B or L-1 status (or their dependent categories). B) You obtain Advance Parole (Form I-131). C) You receive an emergency travel permit. If you leave without one of these, your green card application will likely be considered abandoned. Is it better to adjust status or do consular processing for the green card application? It depends on your priorities: • Adjustment of Status (AOS): Lets you stay in the U.S. while applying even if your visa expires, often faster, and allows you to request work authorization while waiting. However, you typically cannot travel during the process (unless under certain specific circumstances, such as having a valid H-1B or L-1). • Consular Processing: Usually better if travel flexibility is a priority, but requires attending an interview at a U.S. consulate abroad. Is premium processing worth it? Often, yes. While some officers issue Requests for Evidence (RFEs) under premium processing to extend their decision window, most applicants cannot afford the delays of regular processing (which can take many months). Premium processing provides faster decisions and avoids the risk of adjudication trends shifting over time. In our experience, the vast majority of petitioners choose premium processing and are still approved. Can I file for the EB-1A and the Adjustment of Status at the same time? Yes in most cases (when your priority date is current), but we generally advise against it. Filing for Adjustment of Status signals clear immigrant intent. If your EB-1A is denied, it could make obtaining non–dual intent visas (such as E-1 or E-2) more difficult. The safer approach: secure EB-1A approval first, then apply for Adjustment of Status. What is the difference between a visa and a green card? A visa allows you to enter and stay in the U.S. for a specific purpose and duration (e.g., work, study, tourism). A green card is permanent residency: it lets you live and work in the U.S. indefinitely, travel more freely, and eventually apply for citizenship. Can I apply for a green card while on a student visa (F-1)? Yes, but it depends on your situation. Some students transition to a work visa (like O-1 or H-1B) and later to a green card. Others may qualify directly for categories like EB-1 or marriage-based green cards. Keep in mind that the F-1 visa does not allow “dual intent,” so timing and strategy are very important. What is “dual intent” and which visas allow it? Dual intent means you can hold a temporary visa while also intending to apply for permanent residency (a green card). The H-1B and L-1 visas are true dual intent visas. Most others, such as B-1/B-2, E-2, and F-1, do not permit dual intent, so pursuing a green card from those visas can create complications. The O-1 is a special case: it is not a dual intent visa by law, but in practice, both USCIS and the Department of State usually treat it as if it were. What happens if I lose my job while on a work visa in the U.S.? Generally, work visa holders have a 60-day discretionary grace period after job loss to change status, find a new employer, or leave the U.S. However, as of mid-2025, USCIS appears to be exercising its discretion to shorten or even eliminate this period in practice. There’s a growing trend of Notices to Appear (NTAs) being issued within the grace period, even when individuals have pending H-1B transfers or change-of-status applications. While this contradicts prior enforcement norms, USCIS has not issued formal guidance clarifying the change. As a result, individuals in the grace period face heightened legal risk, including removal proceedings and potential re-entry bans. Acting quickly with legal counsel is more critical than ever. Can I work while waiting for my green card approval? Yes, if you apply for and receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) as part of your Adjustment of Status. Without an EAD, you cannot work until your green card is approved, unless you already hold a valid work visa. Do I need to maintain valid status while applying for a green card? Yes. Unless you are protected by certain exceptions, you generally must remain in valid status until your green card application is filed. Falling out of status before filing can make the process more complicated or even impossible. Can my family members get green cards if I do? Yes. Your spouse and unmarried children under 21 can usually apply as dependents (known as “derivative beneficiaries”) when you apply for your green card. What is the difference between lawful status and unlawful presence? Lawful status means you are legally in the U.S. under the terms of your visa or green card. Unlawful presence refers to the time spent in the U.S. without authorization. Importantly, you can sometimes be out of status but not accruing unlawful presence (for example, while a timely extension is pending). Can I extend my stay in the U.S. without leaving the country? Yes, in some cases. You can request an extension or change of status with USCIS before your authorized stay expires. Approval is not guaranteed, and it depends on your visa type and compliance with U.S. immigration rules. What happens if I am denied entry at the U.S. border? If a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer denies you entry, you may be returned immediately to your country of origin. In some cases, they may cancel your visa. This can have consequences for future applications, depending on the reason for denial. What happens if my visa petition gets denied? You can always reapply, and many cases get approved on a second attempt, even with the same evidence, because decisions can vary between officers. There is no “blacklist.” However, if your denial was for a green card petition, it may affect future applications for nonimmigrant visas (since immigrant intent might be established). It’s important to carefully evaluate strategy before filing an immigrant petition. Can overstaying a visa affect future immigration applications? Yes. Overstaying your visa can make it harder—or sometimes impossible—to get another visa or green card in the future. Overstays of more than 180 days can trigger automatic bans on reentry for up to 3 years. Overstays of more than 365 days will bar you from re-entry for ten years. Always maintain valid status. Does the B-1/B-2 visa allow me to stay 6 months per year in the U.S.? Not exactly. You are usually admitted for up to 6 months per entry, not per year. Technically, you could enter, stay 6 months, leave, and reenter for another 6 months within the same year. However, doing so raises red flags. CBP officers may question whether you are truly visiting for tourism or business, or whether you are working illegally. Frequent or lengthy visits increase the risk of being denied entry and potentially having issues in obtaining a new visa. Rule of thumb: Keep visits shorter (ideally under a month or two) and less frequent, to avoid any issues. What is an RFE? RFEs or Requests for Evidence is not a rejection or necessarily a bad sign. The tone of the RFE can give you an idea of their level of doubt about your petition. The officer reviewing your case might be buying time during busy periods, for example, if they have to give you a response in 15 business days because you filed for premium processing and the workload is too high to process your case in time. If the RFE includes questions about the factual sufficiency or legality of your case, it likely means they need more evidence or more explanations, or both, before approving the case. Neither of these cases signal an outright or even a likely rejection. How many pages should a petition have? A US visa application should be as few pages long as possible to thoroughly document your case. Avoid bulking up your case with evidence that repeats itself or adds minimal value—your lawyer can guide you in this sense. The forms alone take up 15-20 pages, and you will attach evidence and cover letters. Some petitions require more evidence than others. Tukki’s lawyers have seen many O-1A and EB-1A petitions that are as long as 400-1,000 pages, but EB-2 NIW applications that only required 200 pages to sufficiently document the case. For an applicant that received an enormous prize, an Oscar or Nobel prize for example, an O-1A application could be even fewer than 400 pages. We’ve also seen applicants sending more than 2,500 pages, but the length of a visa petition varies on a case by case basis. What is the success rate on immigration applications that Tukki worked on? Tukki actively works with lawyers to assist with your visa applications and all of Tukki’s partner lawyers have success rates above 95% for client visa petitions. Is health insurance in the US necessary to apply for a visa? Health insurance isn’t necessary in order to obtain a visa in the US. However, it is recommended you plan for this expense for as soon as you arrive in the US. What are the total costs of US immigration including legal fees, USCIS fees and any other payments? The total cost for US immigration varies depending on the type of visa and the number of applicants. On average, the all-inclusive cost ranges from $10,000 to $15,000 for a work visa and from $14,000 to $20,000 for a green card. For a family of four, the cost might range from $10,000 to $15,000 for a work visa and from $14,000 to $30,000 for a green card. To know the specific cost of your visa or green card application, consult our visa pricing calculator . What are the main eligibility requirements for an H-1B visa? To qualify for an H-1B visa, you must have a job offer from a U.S. employer for a specialty occupation, meaning a role that requires highly specialized knowledge and at least a bachelor’s degree or higher in a directly related field. If your degree is from outside the U.S., it must be evaluated for equivalency. Additionally, the employer must comply with all Labor Condition Application (LCA) requirements, including paying at least the prevailing wage set by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) for that occupation and location. Can an entrepreneur or startup founder apply for an H-1B visa? Yes. The agency requires a legitimate employer-employee relationship, which typically involves the ability to “hire, pay, fire, supervise, or otherwise control the work” of the beneficiary. This often requires a board of directors or independent investors with decision-making authority over the founder’s employment. How does the H-1B visa lottery system work, and who is exempt? Since the number of H-1B applicants exceeds the available visas, the U.S. government conducts a random lottery each year. There are 85,000 total H-1B visas, with 65,000 under the regular cap and an additional 20,000 reserved for individuals with a U.S. master’s degree or higher. Employers must first submit an electronic registration in March during the lottery period. If selected and approved, the beneficiary can begin working on October 1, the start of the fiscal year. However, some H-1B petitions are cap-exempt and can be filed at any time, bypassing the lottery. This applies to petitions filed by or on behalf of institutions of higher education, nonprofit research organizations, and government research institutions. Additionally, H-1B extensions, transfers, and amendments for individuals already in H-1B status are not subject to the cap and can also be filed at any time. Can my spouse work in the U.S. if I have an H-1B visa? The spouse of an H-1B visa holder can apply for an H-4 visa, but not all H-4 visa holders are eligible to work. Only those whose H-1B spouse has an approved I-140 petition (a step in the Green Card process) can apply for Employment Authorization (EAD). If approved, the H-4 spouse can work for any employer in the U.S. without restrictions. Who qualifies for an EB-2 NIW Green Card? To qualify for an EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver), you must have either an advanced degree (master’s or higher), a bachelor’s degree with at least five years of progressive work experience, or demonstrate exceptional ability in your field. Exceptional ability means a level of expertise significantly above the ordinary, proven by meeting at least three of six USCIS criteria, such as membership in professional associations, recognition from experts in your field, or a significant impact on your industry. Additionally, you must show that your work benefits the U.S. in a meaningful way, such as improving the economy, advancing technology, enhancing healthcare, strengthening national security, or addressing other critical needs. USCIS evaluates this based on how important, urgent, and far-reaching your contributions are. Do I need a job offer or employer sponsorship for an EB-2 NIW? No, one of the main advantages of the EB-2 NIW is that you can self-petition, meaning you do not need a U.S. employer to sponsor you or go through the labor certification (PERM) process, which is typically a lengthy and complex requirement for employer-sponsored Green Cards. Instead, you must prove that your work is in the national interest of the U.S. and that waiving the job offer requirement would benefit the country. How do I demonstrate that my work is in the national interest of the United States? To prove that your work is in the national interest, you must show that it has a direct and significant impact on the U.S. in areas such as technology, healthcare, education, economic growth, or national security. Your contributions should provide clear benefits to the country as a whole, beyond just your employer or local community. You can demonstrate this through government reports, industry publications, media coverage, patents, or letters from experts confirming that your work aligns with national priorities and contributes to broader advancements in society, an industry, or the economy. What kind of evidence strengthens an EB-2 NIW petition? A strong EB-2 NIW petition must demonstrate that you have the expertise and experience to advance your endeavor and that your work has substantial merit and national importance. Evidence may include receiving awards, publishing research, holding patents, and having relevant work experience in your field. Support from employers, investors, or institutions can further strengthen your case. Additional factors include serving as a judge of others' work, holding memberships in prestigious organizations, and being featured in media coverage. The more solid and well-documented your evidence, the stronger your petition. Can I apply for both the O-1 and EB-1A at the same time? Yes. It’s possible to pursue both strategies simultaneously. However, it’s far more common to apply for the O-1 and then pursue the EB-1A. Many applicants use the O-1 as a “bridge” to work legally in the U.S. while building their profile for the EB-1A. The O-1 is temporary, while the EB-1A leads to permanent residency. Can I apply for a green card directly from outside the U.S.? Yes. Through consular processing, you can apply from abroad and attend your immigrant visa interview at a U.S. consulate. You could technically get a green card without having a work visa before. Does being published in major media help in O-1 or EB-1A applications? Yes. Evidence of press coverage—especially in reputable, independent outlets—is strong proof of recognition in your field. However, not all articles are born equal, and some are far more relevant than others. The article should be mostly about you and your work, have a listed author, and date. Can I work as a freelancer on an O-1 visa? Yes, but only if your petition was filed by a U.S. agent. You cannot freelance outside the scope of your petition or through an employer. In addition, you cannot add new employers after the O-1 petition has been filed — even if it was filed through an agent — except in the case of the O-1B, where this is allowed. What happens if my O-1 employer goes out of business? You generally lose status once the employment ends, but you may use the 60-day grace period to find a new sponsor and file a new petition. However, since USCIS has started using its discretion to reduce or even eliminate the grace period in some cases it’s more important than ever to act quickly and consult with legal counsel. Can dependents of O-1 or H-1B visa holders attend public school in the U.S.? Yes. Children with O-3 or H-4 visas may attend public schools without additional authorization. Is it mandatory to hire a lawyer for an O-1 or EB-1A petition? No. Technically you can self-file (for EB-1A) or have an employer file without an attorney. However, due to the complexity of the evidence, most applicants strongly benefit from legal representation. How do recommendation letters help in an O-1 or EB-1A petition? They serve to contextualize and validate your achievements. Strong letters from independent experts can significantly strengthen your case. Letters are not going to be the cornerstone of the application, but are very relevant and helpful to the case. Can I travel abroad while my O-1 petition is pending? Yes, but it depends on how your case is being processed: • Consular processing: If you are outside the U.S. when your petition is approved, you will need to schedule a visa interview and obtain an O-1 visa stamp at a U.S. consulate before reentering. • Change of Status (COS): If you filed your petition as a Change of Status from within the U.S., traveling abroad it’s not allowed and your case will be considered abandoned. Do visa officers care about social media activity? Yes. Consular officers may review public online profiles. Content that contradicts your application (such as posts suggesting unauthorized work) can raise red flags and cause a visa denial. Can O-1 or EB-1A holders sponsor parents for green cards? No. Only U.S. citizens can sponsor parents. Once you become a citizen (typically after holding a green card for 5 years, or 3 years if you became permanent resident through marriage with a US citizen), you may petition for them. What is the “priority date” in green card cases? It’s the date your approved I-130 (family) or I-140 (employment) petition is filed, or if your green card requires a PERM process, the priority date is when the PERM is filed with the department of labor. This determines your place in line for visa availability, which is crucial in categories with backlogs. Can I continue working while my O-1 extension is pending? Yes. If your extension is filed before your current O-1 expires, you are allowed to keep working for up to 240 days while USCIS processes the case. Do O-1 visas have a maximum number of years like H-1B? No. O-1 visas can be renewed indefinitely in increments (usually 1–3 years), as long as you continue to meet the criteria. What’s the difference between “extraordinary ability” and “exceptional ability”? Extraordinary ability is the language you must use in O-1 and EB-1A cases, and it means you are among the very top in your field. Exceptional ability (EB-2 NIW wording) means you have expertise significantly above the average but not necessarily at the very top. Does winning smaller or regional awards help in an O-1/EB-1A case? Yes, but they are generally weaker than major national or international awards. They can still support your profile when combined with stronger evidence. In most cases regional awards are not useful for the awards criteria but are still helpful to establish recognition in your field. Can I switch from a tourist visa to a work visa while in the U.S.? It’s possible through a change of status with USCIS, but officers may question your original intent when entering. Consular processing is often safer. Does having patents help in EB-1A or O-1 petitions? Yes. Patents that have been commercialized or frequently cited can help demonstrate original contributions. However, simply holding a patent that has not been applied or recognized by others in the field is not sufficient to establish this category. Can my employer revoke my green card once it’s approved? No. Once you receive your green card, it belongs to you, not to your employer. However, if fraud or misrepresentation occurred during the process, USCIS may investigate. Can I hold two different visas at the same time? One can have multiple visas stamped in their passport but cannot have multiple statuses while in the US. You can only be in one nonimmigrant status at a time. However, you may switch between statuses if petitions are timely filed. Does volunteering count as work under U.S. immigration law? It can, in many cases. If the activity is something that is normally paid (e.g., designing, performing, consulting), USCIS may treat it as unauthorized employment even if you are unpaid. True volunteering—like helping at a food bank, church, or charity where no one is paid—is generally allowed. How important is peer-reviewed research in EB-1A or EB-2 NIW cases? It depends. For scientists and academics, publications in peer-reviewed journals are often a cornerstone of the case. For professionals in business, arts, or other industries, other types of evidence (press, awards, leadership, impact) may carry more weight. Does being invited as a conference speaker help in an EB-1A or O-1 petition? Absolutely. Speaking engagements—especially at well-known or international conferences—show that you are recognized as an authority in your field. The more selective and prestigious the event, the stronger the evidence. Although it does not fall into a specific category, it is very important for the final merits evaluation. What is the minimum investment required for an E-2 visa? There is no fixed dollar amount in the law. Instead, the investment must be “substantial” relative to the type of business. In practice, amounts under $100,000 are often considered too low, while $150,000–$200,000 or more are typically viewed as stronger. Other factors—such as the number of employees, the type of activity, and the revenue generated—also play an important role. The E-2 is not judged only by a number, but by a combination of factors showing that the business is real, viable, and capable of supporting operations and jobs in the U.S. Does time spent in the U.S. on different visas count toward citizenship eligibility? No, the years spent in the U.S. under temporary visas like F-1, O-1, or H-1B do not count toward the residency requirement for naturalization. The clock for U.S. citizenship starts once you obtain permanent residency (a green card), typically requiring 5 years of continuous residence (or 3 years if married to a U.S. citizen). What is PERM? A PERM (Program Electronic Review Management) is a labor certification issued by the U.S. Department of Labor. It does NOT give immigration status. Instead, it confirms that no qualified and willing U.S. worker is available for the job and that the employer will pay at least the prevailing wage. It is the first step toward most EB-2 and EB-3 green cards. Is PERM a visa or a work permit? No. PERM is not a visa, nor does it provide work authorization or permission to stay in the U.S. It is only the labor certification needed before an employer can file the I-140 immigrant petition. How long does the PERM process take? On average, the full PERM process takes 22-24 months, including prevailing wage (≈6 months), recruitment (60+ days), PERM filing, and DOL adjudication (14-16 months). Audits can extend the timeline. What determines whether a case becomes EB-2 or EB-3? The job requirements define the category, not the candidate’s resume. EB-2 applies if the job requires a Master’s degree or Bachelor’s + 5 years of progressive experience. EB-3 applies to Bachelor-level roles, skilled workers (2+ years experience), or other workers. What happens if a qualified U.S. worker applies during recruitment? The employer cannot continue with the PERM for that position. There are no exceptions or appeals. The employer may restart recruitment after six months. Can the employer change the job description or salary after recruitment begins? No. Once recruitment starts, the job requirements and prevailing wage cannot be changed without restarting the entire process from the beginning. What is the I-140, and why does it matter after PERM? The I-140 Immigrant Petition is the second stage of the EB-2/EB-3 green card process. Once PERM is certified, the employer files the I-140 with USCIS to prove three things: The worker met every PERM requirement before the PERM was filed. The job offer is genuine and permanent. The employer can pay the prevailing wage from the PERM priority date onward. This is known as ability to pay, and USCIS reviews tax returns, annual reports, audited financials, or payroll records to verify it. If any of these elements is unclear, USCIS may issue an RFE, NOID, or denial. The I-140 does not replace the PERM; it confirms that the worker and employer both qualify to move forward to the green card stage. What documents does the employee need for PERM and I-140? The worker must provide: diplomas and transcripts, credential evaluations for foreign degrees, detailed experience letters proving they met all PERM requirements before filing, resume and identity documents. Who must prove ability to pay the prevailing wage from the PERM and how? The employer must demonstrate ability to pay the wage from the PERM priority date onward using tax returns, annual reports, audited financials, or payroll records. This is a common source of I-140 delays or denials. How do layoffs affect a PERM case? Layoffs in the same or similar occupation within the previous six months prevent the employer from starting recruitment or filing PERM. During the layoff window, the employer can still: define the job description and requirements, and request the prevailing wage determination (PWD). But the employer cannot activate the PERM process — meaning no recruitment and no ETA-9089 filing — until the cooling-off period has passed. Once that period ends, the PERM process may proceed normally. What happens if PERM is denied? The employer may: refile a new PERM, correct job requirements and restart recruitment, or request reconsideration in limited cases. Most PERM denials require starting over completely because the process is time-sensitive. There is no mandatory waiting period after a denial—refiling can begin as soon as the employer is ready, as long as no layoffs prevent recruitment and the job requirements are compliant.

H5: EB-5",content page,"EB-1A visa guide: eligibility and evidence requirements VISA GUIDE EB-1A: Extraordinary Ability in Sciences, Arts, Education, Business, or Athletics Green card Introduction The EB-1A is a U.S. immigrant visa for individuals who have reached the top of their field. It&#x27;s part of the first preference employment-based category (EB-1), and it&#x27;s designed for those who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics—recognized through sustained national or international acclaim. While qualifying may seem extremely difficult—and it does require significant effort—you don’t need to have won a Nobel Prize to be eligible. What sets the EB-1A apart from many other green card categories is that it does not require a job offer or employer sponsorship . You can apply as a self-petitioner , as long as you can show that you intend to keep working in your area of expertise. Who is eligible The EB-1A is for individuals who have reached the very top of their profession and can prove it. What matters most is recognition, impact, and the ability to show evidence that others in your field acknowledge your excellence. You might be eligible if you are A venture-backed tech founder A business leader with a history of success and industry influence A scientist with widely cited research or prestigious awards A performer or artist with international exhibitions or critical acclaim A researcher or professor with major publications and conference roles A professional athlete with a record of elite competition or coaching at a national level A thought leader whose work shapes how others in your field think or act Bottom line: If you’ve consistently stood out and your accomplishments are documented, measurable, and recognized, the EB-1A could be a fit—even if your journey doesn’t follow a traditional path. Pros No job offer required You can apply as a self-petitioner—no need for an employer or sponsor. Path to a green card The EB-1A leads directly to permanent residency (green card), not just a temporary work visa. Priority processing This category offers the fastest processing times among all employment-based green card options and typically has no backlog. Flexibility in future work Once approved, you are not tied to a specific employer or role. You can work, consult, or even start a business. No labor certification (PERM) You don’t need to go through the lengthy and uncertain PERM process required in other green card categories. Cons High standard of proof USCIS applies a strict two-step review process. Meeting the minimum criteria is not enough—you must also present a compelling final merits argument that demonstrates you are among the top professionals in your field. This includes strong evidence that your work has received sustained recognition and that the field considers you an expert with significant impact or influence. Requires strong documentation You’ll need solid evidence— like letters, metrics, media, publications—to back up every claim. Can be subjective Even with great credentials, success can depend on how well the case is presented and interpreted. This is why narrative and structure matter . General requirements Extraordinary ability You must demonstrate that you have extraordinary ability in your field—meaning you are among the small percentage at the very top, and your achievements are backed by sustained national or international acclaim. Evidence of recognition You must provide either: A one-time major internationally recognized award, or Evidence that you meet at least 3 out of 10 USCIS criteria (we’ll cover these in detail next). Intent to continue working in your field You must show that you plan to keep working in your area of expertise after you move to the U.S. This doesn’t mean you need a job offer—it can be through self-employment, consulting, a startup, or continued research. Substantial benefit to the US You’ll need to explain how your work will benefit the United States—economically, socially, culturally, scientifically, or otherwise. USCIS interprets this broadly, but it must be clearly articulated. No employer or sponsor required You can apply as a self-petitioner, making this visa ideal for independent professionals, founders, creatives, and others without a formal US job offer. Robust documentation Strong letters of support, published work, media coverage, metrics, and a cohesive narrative are essential. This is a visa where how you present your story matters as much as what you’ve done. Specific requirements (The 10 criteria) 1. Critical role What it is USCIS looks at whether you have played a leading, critical, or essential role for an organization or institution that has a distinguished reputation. This doesn’t require you to be a C-level executive—what matters is that your contributions were vital to the success or operations of a highly regarded organization. Your work must be clearly linked to the organization’s impact, success, or mission. This criterion typically requires that you’ve been in the role for a certain period of time—usually at least one year—but shorter tenures can still qualify if supported by a strong and compelling narrative that demonstrates your influence and the importance of your contributions. Your work must be clearly linked to the organization’s impact, success, or mission. Documentation you need Description of your role and responsibilities Letters from executives, project leads, or institutional heads confirming your importance Proof of the organization’s distinguished reputation (media coverage, rankings, funding, awards, client list) Evidence of outcomes or results tied to your work (metrics, performance data, project success) USCIS may pushback: The organization is not well-known or respected in the field Your role appears routine, administrative, or interchangeable Letters or descriptions lack detail or fail to show how your work was essential There&#x27;s no documentation connecting your efforts to major achievements of the organization How to overcome that: Provide specific examples of initiatives you led or influenced, and their measurable outcomes Include evidence of the organization’s prestige (e.g., press, awards, funding, client base) Use support letters from people with direct knowledge of your work to explain your contributions in context Explain how your skills or leadership were instrumental in key outcomes Examples Startup founder at a VC-backed startup Head of product at a fast-growing startup Lead researcher on a government-funded project at a top-tier university Director of strategy for a company with Fortune 500 clients Senior team member on a high-impact program at a world-renowned NGO Named investigator on a major public grant or scientific breakthrough If you are not ready yet: This is not a category you can typically build overnight—it usually takes time and trust within an organization. That said, it’s worth being strategic. If you&#x27;re currently employed, look for ways to lead important projects , take ownership of high-impact initiatives, and demonstrate measurable value. If those opportunities don’t exist internally, consider getting involved in external organizations in your industry —whether it&#x27;s a association, NGO, or advisory board—where your contributions can play a central role. 2. High remuneration What it is USCIS considers whether you have earned—or will earn—a high salary or other significant compensation compared to others in your field. This includes base salary, bonuses, stock options, equity, or any other form of remuneration. The compensation must be in the top 10% of your field , taking into account your location, role, and the industry standard. Documentation you need Employment contracts or offer letters showing your salary Pay stubs, tax returns, or bank statements proving past compensation Third-party wage data or salary surveys for your occupation and region (e.g., from Glassdoor, Payscale, BLS) Valuation or documentation of stock/equity holdings Comparative charts showing how your compensation ranks within your profession USCIS may pushback: Salary is typical or only slightly above average for your role or industry No clear comparison is provided to show how your pay stands out Compensation is self-reported without third-party or contractual confirmation Equity or bonuses are speculative, with no proof of actual value How to overcome that: Use credible, well-known salary databases to show your earnings are in the top percentile If you&#x27;re outside the U.S., provide localized compensation data—don’t just convert to USD For founders or early-stage startup employees, document external validation (e.g., funding rounds, investor due diligence, startup valuations) Examples Salary/payroll through your employer Fellowships Grants High valued equity Freelance work Bonuses or other types of compensation If you are not ready yet: Let’s be honest—this isn’t exactly a category you can “strategically build.” We assume you&#x27;re already trying to earn more money (who isn’t?). While negotiating a raise just for immigration purposes might not fly, it’s still worth knowing that offers, bonuses, or equity packages —especially if well-documented—can make a difference. If you&#x27;re in a fast-growing industry or high-demand role, keep track of any indicators that your compensation stands out. 3. Awards What it is You’ve received national or international awards for excellence in your field. This can include prizes from respected institutions, conference awards, or academic recognitions. You can also qualify if the award was given to a team , as long as you were officially named as a recipient. Documentation you need Certificates or official notices of the award Description of the award and its purpose Criteria used for selecting recipients Evidence of who granted the award (e.g., respected institution, professional body) Context that shows the award’s prestige (e.g., media coverage, list of past recipients, number of applicants) USCIS may pushback: The award is local, internal to a single company, or academic in nature (e.g., classroom prize, employee of the month) There&#x27;s no evidence of national or international recognition The selection process isn’t clearly competitive or merit-based The beneficiary is not clearly named in the award (e.g., generic team acknowledgments) How to overcome that: Provide third-party evidence (media coverage, press releases) to show the award’s impact Include details about eligibility, number of recipients, and selection process Submit expert letters explaining the award’s significance in your field If the award is team-based, document your individual role and why your contribution was essential Examples VC funding A national engineering award given by a professional association “Top Innovator Under 35” award by a global tech publication Research prizes from well-known academic or research institutions Recognitions at international conferences judged by experts If you are not ready yet: Raise capital from institutional investors Apply for competitive fellowships, grants, or industry awards Submit your work to juried competitions or peer-reviewed programs Increase your visibility by contributing to major conferences or innovation challenges Join organizations that offer recognition programs and work toward earning those distinctions 4. Judging What it is USCIS wants to see whether you’ve served as a judge or evaluator of other professionals’ work in your field (or a closely related one). This can be through peer reviews, selection panels, judging a hackathon, a startup competition, a pitch competition, even reviewing open source code, or any role where your expertise is used to assess the contributions of others. You can qualify if you judged their work individually or as part of a panel. Documentation you need Invitations to judge or review Proof that you actually completed the evaluation (as opposed to just being invited) Descriptions of the event, journal, or organization involved Evidence that the work you judged was in the same or allied field USCIS may pushback: You were only invited but didn’t actually participate The judging was undocumented The judging was part of your job duties (e.g. evaluating team members or reviewing code before deployment) You judged students rather than the work of other professionals or experts The work reviewed wasn’t in your field of expertise How to overcome that: Submit screenshots, emails, or certificates confirming you judged the work of others Provide details of the review process and selection standards Include information about the prestige or selectivity of what was being judged (e.g., an academic journal, funding program). While this is not mandatory, it provides helpful context and enhances your profile. Attach a letter from the organization confirming your participation and its importance Examples Peer reviewer for a scholarly journal in your discipline Invited to select members for a startup accelerator Evaluator for research funding programs or innovation grants Judge for a professional competition, pitch event, hackathon, or startup accelerator Member of a dissertation or thesis committee at a research institution If you are not ready yet: Volunteer as a reviewer for industry journals or conference abstracts Get involved in hackathons and perform as a judge Join scientific, business, or creative communities that organize competitive events Connect with professors or peers and offer to review papers 5. Membership What it is USCIS looks for evidence that you are or have been a member of associations in your field that require outstanding achievements for admission. These associations must evaluate applicants based on merit , using a panel of recognized national or international experts. In some cases, basic membership may not meet the standard—especially if it’s open to anyone with a degree or who pays a fee. However, advanced levels of membership, select committees , or being elevated to an advisory or leadership board within the organization can qualify, even if the general membership is less selective. This is not about being part of a general professional group—membership must be exclusive and merit-based , not just open to anyone with a degree or who pays a fee. It must also be your membership , not your company’s. Being affiliated with an association simply because your employer is a member, or because your company belongs to an industry group, does not meet this requirement. That said, there are gray areas —for example, with startup accelerators or founder-focused programs. If the company was accepted based on your individual merit as a founder or leader, and you can show that you were the one evaluated, this may still qualify. Also, sometimes it’s not just about being a member , but about your involvement in the organization. Serving on committees, contributing to publications, or playing an active role can strengthen the case—especially when higher levels of participation are merit-based. Documentation you need Proof of membership (certificate, letter, ID) Official criteria for admission to the association Description of the selection process (e.g., peer-reviewed, by invitation only, steps to get admitted) List of reviewers or selection committee members (ideally experts in the field) Documentation showing the association’s reputation in your profession USCIS may pushback: Membership is open to anyone who pays dues or meets basic education/experience thresholds The association is not well-known or respected in the field The petitioner fails to show that the selection process is based on outstanding achievement judged by experts The membership level cited doesn’t require distinction (e.g., regular vs. fellow) How to overcome that: Clarify what level of membership you hold and what standards it required Include evidence that shows how competitive or selective the process is Provide expert letters attesting to the prestige of the association and its relevance in your field Translate and explain foreign or lesser-known memberships with strong documentation Examples IEEE Fellow (requires nomination and peer review) Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Membership in a national academy (e.g., National Academy of Sciences) British Computer Society (Fellow level) Invitation-based boards or scientific councils evaluated by field leaders Renowned accelerator such as YC If you are not ready yet: Aim for achievement-based memberships rather than open ones Contribute to the field in ways that make you eligible for selective fellowships or professional titles Network and collaborate with associations known to recognize exceptional members Apply for fellow-level or distinguished titles , even if you already have basic membership 6. Original contributions What it is This criterion focuses on whether you’ve made original contributions —scientific, scholarly, technical, or business-related—that are considered significant within your field . It’s not enough to do original work; it must have had a meaningful impact , shown through recognition, usage, or measurable influence. What matters is not just the impact within your own company —USCIS is looking for contributions that have influenced the broader field . That could mean your work has been cited, adopted, replicated, commercialized, or otherwise recognized by peers, institutions, or the industry at large. Documentation you need Letters from recognized experts explaining the contribution’s significance in the field Published research that has been cited frequently or sparked further innovation Patents or licensed intellectual property in active use Evidence of commercial applications or product adoption Proof of your work being integrated into industry standards, technologies, or practices Awards, grants, or media coverage linked directly to your innovation USCIS may pushback: The work is original but lacks clear impact or recognition in the field Letters of support are vague, lack detail, or come from non-experts There’s no evidence the contribution has been used, cited, or built upon The work was team-based and doesn’t show your specific role How to overcome that: Submit support letters from leading figures in your field, explaining why your work is groundbreaking Include citations, adoption metrics, or usage data Provide contextual evidence —why your idea or method solved a key challenge or opened new pathways If it’s team-based, highlight your leadership or origin of the idea , backed by collaborators or managers Examples A patented algorithm now used in commercial software A business model adopted widely in your industry A research paper that’s become a foundational reference in your field A new methodology or protocol implemented across multiple institutions A product innovation that’s generated measurable value or societal impact If you are not ready yet: Focus on projects that solve real industry problems and are likely to scale or attract attention Collaborate with institutions or partners that can help bring your ideas to market or publication Track and document impact over time—citations, product metrics, testimonials, etc. Be intentional about sharing your innovations through conferences, media, or professional networks Contribute to open source communities 7. Scholarly articles What it is USCIS assesses whether you have authored scholarly articles in your field, published in professional journals, academic publications, or other recognized media . These articles should demonstrate original thinking or research, and must be targeted at professionals or academics— not general audiences . You don’t have to be the sole or first author, but your name must appear as a contributor. Documentation you need Full copies of the published articles Proof of publication (journal name, issue, date, and your name as author) Description of the publication’s reputation, scope, and audience Evidence of peer review or editorial standards Optional if you have it: Include metrics like impact factor or citation rates Add a short explanation of your article’s contribution to the field Highlight how the article has been used, cited, or referenced Good for final merits USCIS may pushback: The publication is not considered scholarly (e.g., blogs, newsletters) Articles are not clearly connected to your field of extraordinary ability There’s insufficient information about the publication’s relevance or audience Your contribution is unclear (e.g., ghostwriting, no authorship credit) How to overcome that: Provide a journal description , including its peer-review process, target audience, and distribution Examples Articles in peer-reviewed academic journals (e.g., Journal of Applied Physics, Harvard Business Review) Papers published in official conference proceedings Contributions to professional trade journals with broad industry readership Co-authored publications where you played a clear role in developing the content Articles in industry-specific journals or academic publications Papers presented at nationally or internationally recognized conferences Research contributions published by professional organizations If you are not ready yet: Submit work to journals, publications or conferences relevant to your field (many accept first-time authors) Write and publish a scholarly article in a peer-reviewed academic journal or a respected technical publication in your field which has an editorial process to publish articles Collaborate with researchers or experts (professors at Universities working on a research where they need industry experts) who are experienced in scholarly publishing 8. Published materials about you What it is This criterion looks for published material in professional publications, major trade outlets, or major media that is about you and your work in the field for which you’re seeking the EB-1A visa. It must go beyond a brief mention—USCIS is looking for substantive coverage that discusses your contributions, impact, or leadership in your area of expertise. Documentation you need Full copies or screenshots of the articles, showing: Title, author, publication, and date Substantive content focusing on you and your work English translations (if applicable) Proof that the publication is considered major or professionally recognized (e.g., readership stats, industry reputation, media kit, similarweb.com ) USCIS may pushback: The material only references you briefly or generically (e.g., name in a list) The content is not clearly about your work in the field The publication is not recognized as a major media or professional outlet The article focuses on a team or company, and doesn’t highlight your individual role How to overcome that: Choose articles where your contributions are clearly explained and linked to your achievements Provide context about the publication&#x27;s influence in your field (readership data, impact, audience) If you&#x27;re part of a team, supplement with letters or documentation showing your specific role Examples A feature profile about your groundbreaking research in a leading science magazine An interview in a business journal where you discuss your innovations and leadership Press coverage of a product launch or project you led, highlighting your expertise Coverage of a conference presentation where you were a main speaker TV or radio interviews about you and your work If you are not ready yet: Build relationships with journalists covering your industry/area of expertise Work on compelling/unique content, with the goal to become a trusted voice in your field Pitch your story or projects to relevant media outlets Present at major events and share those appearances online to attract coverage Write thought leadership content that positions you as an authority Collaborate with your employer’s PR or marketing team to get visibility in industry press 9. Display of the person&#x27;s work in the field at artistic exhibitions or showcases What it means This criterion primarily applies to artists, designers, and other creative professionals. USCIS looks for evidence that your original artistic work has been publicly displayed in recognized exhibitions or showcases—whether physical or virtual. Although this category is mainly intended for artists, USCIS has acknowledged that the exhibition of work in a non-artistic field can also qualify. For example, presenting your work at a professional conference may be considered. What kind of documentation you need Invitations or confirmations from the exhibiting organization Photographs or promotional materials showing your work and name Press coverage or catalog entries Evidence that the event was public and recognized in your field Evidence that the exhibited work is your own For virtual exhibitions: audience data, screenshots, platform info, and curatorial context Why USCIS might deny this criterion Your work was displayed but you were not identified as the presenter The event lacks recognition or credibility in the creative field There’s no clear connection between the exhibition and your reputation The work exhibited is not yours Ways to overcome these issues Focus on solo or curated group exhibitions that are open to the public Show the reputation of the gallery, festival, or institution Include letters from curators or organizers verifying your role and the significance of the exhibition Avoid informal or internal company displays unless they were part of a notable event Examples that may qualify A solo or featured show at a known contemporary art space Participation in a juried design biennale Selection for an international photography exhibit Showcasing your fashion collection at a major industry event Inclusion in a digital exhibition hosted by a recognized institution or platform If you are not ready yet: Submit your work to juried competitions or open calls for exhibitions Document your participation clearly—photos, programs, curators’ bios Build relationships with institutions that organize or curate public showcases For virtual creators: prioritize platforms with curation, credibility, and audience reach 10. Commercial success in the performing arts, as shown by box office receipts or record, cassette, compact disk, or video sales What it means This criterion is for performers, musicians, filmmakers, and other artists whose work has seen measurable commercial success. It’s about sales and audience impact—not just critical acclaim. USCIS focuses on quantifiable metrics like ticket sales, music streaming numbers, chart rankings, or box office revenue. The work must be in the performing arts, and the success must be clearly attributable to you. What kind of documentation you need Box office reports or gross revenue statements Music streaming or download statistics (Spotify, Apple, YouTube, etc.) Sales reports for albums, books, or performances Chart rankings (Billboard, iTunes, Amazon, etc.) Press coverage or industry reports documenting commercial success Distributor or venue statements verifying your impact on performance turnout Why USCIS might deny this criterion The sales data is vague, unverifiable, or unrelated to your individual work The project involved many people but your role wasn’t clearly identified The metrics show moderate success, but not standout commercial impact The performance was released but didn’t generate significant sales or viewership Ways to overcome these issues Use third-party data and avoid self-reported or inflated claims Include expert letters that contextualize your success in the industry Provide comparisons or benchmarks to show why your numbers are impressive Examples that may qualify A lead actor in a film that grossed significantly above industry averages A musician whose single topped regional charts and hit high streaming numbers A dancer featured in a sold-out international tour A comedian with a Netflix special and verified audience stats If you are not ready yet: Focus on platforms that generate trackable public metrics (e.g., YouTube, Spotify) Promote your work through official channels that report performance data Build a release strategy that targets both reach and revenue Collect and archive your own stats with screenshots and third-party verification Final thoughts The EB-1A green card is a powerful option for individuals at the top of their field who want to live and work permanently in the U.S. But USCIS doesn’t just look for talent—it looks for proof of sustained national or international acclaim, and a persuasive narrative that ties everything together. This visa has high standards, but it’s also one of the few green card options that doesn’t require a job offer, sponsor, or employer. That makes it an incredibly valuable opportunity for an entrepreneur building a high-impact company, a technologist leading innovation, a researcher pushing the boundaries of knowledge, a business leader driving growth, or a scientist making transformative discoveries. Many professionals rule themselves out too quickly, assuming the EB-1A is only for Nobel Prize winners or household names. In reality, with the right framing and a strong legal strategy, even those without widespread fame can build a successful case—especially when their work has clearly moved the field forward. WE CAN HELP Need more clarity? Find quick answers to frequent EB-1A visa questions from our legal experts What is EB-1A? A visa for individuals with extraordinary ability. How much documentation do I need to file a visa petition for an EB-1A or O-1A visa? In US immigration processes, your claims must be more likely than not to be true. This means if something appears more true than false, USCIS should accept it as true. To meet this standard, the visa petitioner should provide documents that convincingly support the claim’s validity. For instance, to prove you received VC funding, you could provide signed SAFE agreements with a VC, a published article about your funding round, and documentation about the relevance of the VC. Keep in mind that theory and practice do not always perfectly align. It’s crucial you speak to an experienced legal team to avoid spending time and money on documentation that does not support your case. Is it possible to re-apply to the USCIS if your application to the O-1A or EB-1A visas is rejected? Yes, you can reapply as many times as you wish. However, bear in mind that when you submit a green card petition or it’s submitted on your behalf, immigration authorities may sometimes see this as an indication that you plan to live in the US permanently (immigrant intent). This is incompatible with a key requirement for most temporary visas, which must express an intent to relocate to the US temporarily only. If you plan to, or need to file a temporary visa application after filing an EB-1A application, this may affect your eligibility to renew or obtain your temporary visa. Rules around resubmissions are nuanced, so it is advisable to consult with an experienced immigration attorney to understand all the implications. Can I file for the EB-1A and the Adjustment of Status at the same time? Yes in most cases (when your priority date is current), but we generally advise against it. Filing for Adjustment of Status signals clear immigrant intent. If your EB-1A is denied, it could make obtaining non–dual intent visas (such as E-1 or E-2) more difficult. The safer approach: secure EB-1A approval first, then apply for Adjustment of Status. Can I apply for both the O-1 and EB-1A at the same time? Yes. It’s possible to pursue both strategies simultaneously. However, it’s far more common to apply for the O-1 and then pursue the EB-1A. Many applicants use the O-1 as a “bridge” to work legally in the U.S. while building their profile for the EB-1A. The O-1 is temporary, while the EB-1A leads to permanent residency.

H5: EB-5",content page,"O-1A visa guide: requirements, criteria, and process VISA GUIDE O-1A: Extraordinary Ability in Sciences, Education, Athletics, or Business Nonimmigrant visa Introduction The O-1A visa is a nonimmigrant visa specifically designed for individuals who have reached the top of their field in sciences, education, business, or athletics. What sets the O-1A apart is that, unlike the H-1B, it has no annual cap or rigid requirements around salary, company size, or business history. There’s no minimum salary threshold, nor are there strict expectations regarding the number of employees or how long a company has been operating. Additionally, the O-1A allows for sponsorship through a U.S. agent rather than a traditional employer, offering greater flexibility for freelancers, consultants, or those working on multiple projects. To apply for the O-1A, you must meet at least 3 out of 8 specific criteria defined by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and craft a compelling narrative that positions you as a leading figure in your field. Who is eligible The O-1A visa is a U.S. work visa designed for individuals with extraordinary ability in their field. But don’t let that phrase intimidate you—extraordinary ability doesn’t mean you need international fame or public celebrity. It means you&#x27;ve consistently performed at a level above your peers and have the track record to prove it. This visa is open to professionals across a wide range of industries—not just scientists and CEOs. What matters is that you’ve built a career that reflects excellence, impact, and recognition, whether on a national or international scale. It also helps to have a somewhat public profile—being visible, active, and seen as a thought leader or reference in your field can strengthen your case significantly. O-1A candidates come from diverse backgrounds Startup founders and business owners Tech executives, scientists and researchers Professional athletes, technology professionals Journalists Anyone who can show sustained achievements in their area of expertise. Pros Not subject to an annual lottery. No minimum wage requirement. No degree required. Flexible sponsorship options available, including sponsorship by an agent—an individual or entity designated to act on your behalf—instead of a single payroll employer. This allows you to work for multiple employers. Good option for new/small employers. A good step to start building an EB-1A extraordinary ability green card, which has the option to self-petition, without any employer involvement. Cons Requires a higher level of individual experience and credentials in your field compared to other visa categories. Employment is limited to the specific area of extraordinary ability. Self-petition applications are not permitted. General requirements Evidence of extraordinary ability You must provide documentation that proves you are among the small percentage who have risen to the top of your field. This can include a mix of awards, media coverage, high-impact contributions, publications, or other achievements. A U.S. petitioner You cannot self-petition. A U.S. employer, agent, or organization must sponsor your application. Strong supporting documentation Beyond satisfying the 3 or more criteria, your application should tell a cohesive story backed by well-organized evidence. This may include recommendation letters, contracts, media articles, patents, metrics of success, and more. Continue working in your area of extraordinary ability in the U.S. Specific requirements (The 8 criteria) 1. Critical role What it is USCIS looks at whether you have played a leading, critical, or essential role for an organization or institution that has a distinguished reputation. This doesn’t require you to be a C-level executive—what matters is that your contributions were vital to the success or operations of a highly regarded organization. Your work must be clearly linked to the organization’s impact, success, or mission. This criterion typically requires that you’ve been in the role for a certain period of time —usually at least one year— but shorter tenures can still qualify if supported by a strong and compelling narrative that demonstrates your influence and the importance of your contributions. Your work must be clearly linked to the organization’s impact, success, or mission. Documentation you need Description of your role and responsibilities Letters from executives, project leads, or institutional heads confirming your importance Proof of the organization’s distinguished reputation (media coverage, rankings, funding, awards, client list) Evidence of outcomes or results tied to your work (metrics, performance data, project success) USCIS may pushback: The organization is not well-known or respected in the field Your role appears routine, administrative, or interchangeable Letters or descriptions lack detail or fail to show how your work was essential There&#x27;s no documentation connecting your efforts to major achievements of the organization How to overcome that: Provide specific examples of initiatives you led or influenced, and their measurable outcomes Include evidence of the organization’s prestige (e.g., press, awards, funding, client base) Use support letters from people with direct knowledge of your work to explain your contributions in context Explain how your skills or leadership were instrumental in key outcomes Examples Startup founder at a VC-backed startup Head of product at a fast-growing startup Lead researcher on a government-funded project at a top-tier university Director of strategy for a company with Fortune 500 clients Senior team member on a high-impact program at a world-renowned NGO Named investigator on a major public grant or scientific breakthrough If you are not ready yet: This is not a category you can typically build overnight—it usually takes time and trust within an organization. That said, it’s worth being strategic. If you&#x27;re currently employed, look for ways to lead important projects , take ownership of high-impact initiatives, and demonstrate measurable value. If those opportunities don’t exist internally, consider getting involved in external organizations in your industry —whether it&#x27;s a association, NGO, or advisory board—where your contributions can play a central role. 2. High remuneration What it is USCIS considers whether you have earned—or will earn—a high salary or other significant compensation compared to others in your field. This includes base salary, bonuses, stock options, equity, or any other form of remuneration. The compensation must be in the top 10% of your field , taking into account your location, role, and the industry standard. Documentation you need Employment contracts or offer letters showing your salary Pay stubs, tax returns, or bank statements proving past compensation Third-party wage data or salary surveys for your occupation and region (e.g., from Glassdoor, Payscale, BLS) Valuation or documentation of stock/equity holdings Comparative charts showing how your compensation ranks within your profession USCIS may pushback: Salary is typical or only slightly above average for your role or industry No clear comparison is provided to show how your pay stands out Compensation is self-reported without third-party or contractual confirmation Equity or bonuses are speculative, with no proof of actual value How to overcome that: Use credible, well-known salary databases to show your earnings are in the top percentile If you&#x27;re outside the U.S., provide localized compensation data—don’t just convert to USD For founders or early-stage startup employees, document external validation (e.g., funding rounds, investor due diligence, startup valuations) Examples Salary/payroll through your employer Fellowships Grants High valued equity Freelance work Bonuses or other types of compensation If you are not ready yet: Let’s be honest—this isn’t exactly a category you can “strategically build.” We assume you&#x27;re already trying to earn more money (who isn’t?). While negotiating a raise just for immigration purposes might not fly, it’s still worth knowing that offers, bonuses, or equity packages —especially if well-documented—can make a difference. If you&#x27;re in a fast-growing industry or high-demand role, keep track of any indicators that your compensation stands out. 3. Awards What it is You’ve received national or international awards for excellence in your field. This can include prizes from respected institutions, conference awards, or academic recognitions. You can also qualify if the award was given to a team , as long as you were officially named as a recipient. Documentation you need Certificates or official notices of the award Description of the award and its purpose Criteria used for selecting recipients Evidence of who granted the award (e.g., respected institution, professional body) Context that shows the award’s prestige (e.g., media coverage, list of past recipients, number of applicants) USCIS may pushback: The award is local, internal to a single company, or academic in nature (e.g., classroom prize, employee of the month) There&#x27;s no evidence of national or international recognition The selection process isn’t clearly competitive or merit-based The beneficiary is not clearly named in the award (e.g., generic team acknowledgments) How to overcome that: Provide third-party evidence (media coverage, press releases) to show the award’s impact Include details about eligibility, number of recipients, and selection process Submit expert letters explaining the award’s significance in your field If the award is team-based, document your individual role and why your contribution was essential Examples VC funding A national engineering award given by a professional association “Top Innovator Under 35” award by a global tech publication Research prizes from well-known academic or research institutions Recognitions at international conferences judged by experts If you are not ready yet: Raise capital from institutional investors Apply for competitive fellowships, grants, or industry awards Submit your work to juried competitions or peer-reviewed programs Increase your visibility by contributing to major conferences or innovation challenges Join organizations that offer recognition programs and work toward earning those distinctions 4. Judging What it is USCIS wants to see whether you’ve served as a judge or evaluator of other professionals’ work in your field (or a closely related one). This can be through peer reviews, selection panels, judging a hackathon, a startup competition, a pitch competition, even reviewing open source code, or any role where your expertise is used to assess the contributions of others. You can qualify if you judged their work individually or as part of a panel. Documentation you need Invitations to judge or review Proof that you actually completed the evaluation (as opposed to just being invited) Descriptions of the event, journal, or organization involved Evidence that the work you judged was in the same or allied field USCIS may pushback: You were only invited but didn’t actually participate The judging was undocumented The judging was part of your job duties (e.g. evaluating team members or reviewing open source code) You judged students rather than the work of other professionals or experts The work reviewed wasn’t in your field of expertise How to overcome that: Submit screenshots, emails, or certificates confirming you judged the work of others Provide details of the review process and selection standards Include information about the prestige or selectivity of what was being judged (e.g., an academic journal, funding program). While this is not mandatory, it provides helpful context and enhances your profile. Attach a letter from the organization confirming your participation and its importance Examples Peer reviewer for a scholarly journal in your discipline Invited to select members for a startup accelerator Evaluator for research funding programs or innovation grants Judge for a professional competition, pitch event, hackathon, or startup accelerator Member of a dissertation or thesis committee at a research institution If you are not ready yet: Volunteer as a reviewer for industry journals or conference abstracts Get involved in hackathons and perform as a judge Join scientific, business, or creative communities that organize competitive events Connect with professors or peers and offer to review papers 5. Membership What it is USCIS looks for evidence that you are or have been a member of associations in your field that require outstanding achievements for admission. These associations must evaluate applicants based on merit , using a panel of recognized national or international experts. In some cases, basic membership may not meet the standard—especially if it’s open to anyone with a degree or who pays a fee. However, advanced levels of membership , select committees, or being elevated to an advisory or leadership board within the organization can qualify, even if the general membership is less selective. This is not about being part of a general professional group—membership must be exclusive and merit-based , not just open to anyone with a degree or who pays a fee. It must also be your membership , not your company’s. Being affiliated with an association simply because your employer is a member, or because your company belongs to an industry group, does not meet this requirement. That said, there are gray areas —for example, with startup accelerators or founder-focused programs. If the company was accepted based on your individual merit as a founder or leader, and you can show that you were the one evaluated, this may still qualify. Also, sometimes it’s not just about being a member , but about your involvement in the organization. Serving on committees, contributing to publications, or playing an active role can strengthen the case—especially when higher levels of participation are merit-based. Documentation you need Proof of membership (certificate, letter, ID) Official criteria for admission to the association Description of the selection process (e.g., peer-reviewed, by invitation only, steps to get admitted) List of reviewers or selection committee members (ideally experts in the field) Documentation showing the association’s reputation in your profession USCIS may pushback: Membership is open to anyone who pays dues or meets basic education/experience thresholds The association is not well-known or respected in the field The petitioner fails to show that the selection process is based on outstanding achievement judged by experts The membership level cited doesn’t require distinction (e.g., regular vs. fellow) How to overcome that: Clarify what level of membership you hold and what standards it required Include evidence that shows how competitive or selective the process is Provide expert letters attesting to the prestige of the association and its relevance in your field Translate and explain foreign or lesser-known memberships with strong documentation Examples IEEE Fellow (requires nomination and peer review) Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Membership in a national academy (e.g., National Academy of Sciences) British Computer Society (Fellow level) Invitation-based boards or scientific councils evaluated by field leaders Renowned accelerator such as YC If you are not ready yet: Aim for achievement-based memberships rather than open ones Contribute to the field in ways that make you eligible for selective fellowships or professional titles Network and collaborate with associations known to recognize exceptional members Apply for fellow-level or distinguished titles , even if you already have basic membership 6. Original contributions What it is This criterion focuses on whether you’ve made original contributions —scientific, scholarly, technical, or business-related—that are considered significant within your field . It’s not enough to do original work; it must have had a meaningful impact , shown through recognition, usage, or measurable influence. What matters is not just the impact within your own company —USCIS is looking for contributions that have influenced the broader field . That could mean your work has been cited, adopted, replicated, commercialized, or otherwise recognized by peers, institutions, or the industry at large. Documentation you need Letters from recognized experts explaining the contribution’s significance in the field Published research that has been cited frequently or sparked further innovation Patents or licensed intellectual property in active use Evidence of commercial applications or product adoption Proof of your work being integrated into industry standards, technologies, or practices Awards, grants, or media coverage linked directly to your innovation USCIS may pushback: The work is original but lacks clear impact or recognition in the field Letters of support are vague, lack detail, or come from non-experts There’s no evidence the contribution has been used, cited, or built upon The work was team-based and doesn’t show your specific role How to overcome that: Submit support letters from leading figures in your field, explaining why your work is groundbreaking Include citations, adoption metrics, or usage data Provide contextual evidence —why your idea or method solved a key challenge or opened new pathways If it’s team-based, highlight your leadership or origin of the idea , backed by collaborators or managers Examples A patented algorithm now used in commercial software A business model adopted widely in your industry A research paper that’s become a foundational reference in your field A new methodology or protocol implemented across multiple institutions A product innovation that’s generated measurable value or societal impact If you are not ready yet: Focus on projects that solve real industry problems and are likely to scale or attract attention Collaborate with institutions or partners that can help bring your ideas to market or publication Track and document impact over time—citations, product metrics, testimonials, etc. Be intentional about sharing your innovations through conferences, media, or professional networks Contribute to open source communities 7. Scholarly articles What it is USCIS assesses whether you have authored scholarly articles in your field, published in professional journals, academic publications, or other recognized media . These articles should demonstrate original thinking or research, and must be targeted at professionals or academics— not general audiences . You don’t have to be the sole or first author, but your name must appear as a contributor. Documentation you need Full copies of the published articles Proof of publication (journal name, issue, date, and your name as author) Description of the publication’s reputation, scope, and audience Evidence of peer review or editorial standards Optional if you have it: Include metrics like impact factor or citation rates Add a short explanation of your article’s contribution to the field Highlight how the article has been used, cited, or referenced Good for final merits USCIS may pushback: The publication is not considered scholarly (e.g., blogs, newsletters) Articles are not clearly connected to your field of extraordinary ability There’s insufficient information about the publication’s relevance or audience Your contribution is unclear (e.g., ghostwriting, no authorship credit) How to overcome that: Provide a journal description , including its peer-review process, target audience, and distribution Examples Articles in peer-reviewed academic journals (e.g., Journal of Applied Physics, Harvard Business Review) Papers published in official conference proceedings Contributions to professional trade journals with broad industry readership Co-authored publications where you played a clear role in developing the content Articles in industry-specific journals or academic publications Papers presented at nationally or internationally recognized conferences Research contributions published by professional organizations If you are not ready yet: Submit work to journals, publications or conferences relevant to your field (many accept first-time authors) Write and publish a scholarly article in a peer-reviewed academic journal or a respected technical publication in your field which has an editorial process to publish articles Collaborate with researchers or experts (professors at Universities working on a research where they need industry experts) who are experienced in scholarly publishing 8. Published materials about you What it is This criterion looks for published material in professional publications, major trade outlets, or major media that is about you and your work in the field for which you’re seeking the O-1A visa. It must go beyond a brief mention—USCIS is looking for substantive coverage that discusses your contributions, impact, or leadership in your area of expertise. Documentation you need Full copies or screenshots of the articles, showing: Title, author, publication, and date Substantive content focusing on you and your work English translations (if applicable) Proof that the publication is considered major or professionally recognized (e.g., readership stats, industry reputation, media kit, similarweb.com ) USCIS may pushback: The material only references you briefly or generically (e.g., name in a list) The content is not clearly about your work in the field The publication is not recognized as a major media or professional outlet The article focuses on a team or company, and doesn’t highlight your individual role How to overcome that: Choose articles where your contributions are clearly explained and linked to your achievements Provide context about the publication&#x27;s influence in your field (readership data, impact, audience) If you&#x27;re part of a team, supplement with letters or documentation showing your specific role Examples A feature profile about your groundbreaking research in a leading science magazine An interview in a business journal where you discuss your innovations and leadership Press coverage of a product launch or project you led, highlighting your expertise Coverage of a conference presentation where you were a main speaker TV or radio interviews about you and your work If you are not ready yet: Build relationships with journalists covering your industry/area of expertise Work on compelling/unique content, with the goal to become a trusted voice in your field Pitch your story or projects to relevant media outlets Present at major events and share those appearances online to attract coverage Write thought leadership content that positions you as an authority Collaborate with your employer’s PR or marketing team to get visibility in industry press Final thoughts The O-1A visa is one of the most flexible and powerful ways for accomplished professionals to work in the United States. Whether you’re an entrepreneur building a high-impact venture, a technologist driving innovation, a researcher or scientist advancing your field, or a business leader shaping industry trends, this visa can open doors—if you know how to position your achievements. Qualifying isn’t just about doing great work. It’s about demonstrating your excellence in a way that aligns with USCIS criteria. That means showing a sustained record of significant contributions, recognized leadership, and evidence that sets you apart. Many talented people underestimate their eligibility, assuming that only globally famous figures qualify. In reality, with the right strategy and preparation, even early-stage founders and professionals can build a compelling case. WE CAN HELP Need more clarity? Find quick answers to frequent O-1A visa questions from our legal experts How much documentation do I need to file a visa petition for an EB-1A or O-1A visa? In US immigration processes, your claims must be more likely than not to be true. This means if something appears more true than false, USCIS should accept it as true. To meet this standard, the visa petitioner should provide documents that convincingly support the claim’s validity. For instance, to prove you received VC funding, you could provide signed SAFE agreements with a VC, a published article about your funding round, and documentation about the relevance of the VC. Keep in mind that theory and practice do not always perfectly align. It’s crucial you speak to an experienced legal team to avoid spending time and money on documentation that does not support your case. Can my company sponsor me for an O-1A if I hold equity in it? According to recent USCIS policy, yes. In general, the agency requires a legitimate employer-employee relationship, which typically involves the ability to “hire, pay, fire, supervise, or otherwise control the work” of the beneficiary. Since this policy is new and USCIS has provided little guidance, it remains unclear how these requirements will be applied in the O-1 context. Can the spouses of O-1 visa holders work? No. Spouses of O-1 visa holders receive an O-3 visa, which allows them to live in the U.S. but not to work. They can study, get a driver’s license, open a bank account, and travel in and out of the country freely, but employment is not permitted. What are the typical questions in the O-1 consular interview? Questions vary, but the most common is: “Tell me why you are extraordinary?” Be ready with a concise summary of your accomplishments. This is the time to confidently highlight your achievements, not to be modest. You should also be prepared to explain the details of your U.S. job—your duties, employer, compensation, and location. How long does it take to get an O-1 visa approved? With premium processing, most O-1 petitions are decided within 15 business days. Without premium processing, a decision can take several months, depending on USCIS workload. The preparation stage—collecting evidence, drafting recommendation letters, and organizing the petition—typically takes anywhere from 6 weeks to 6 months, depending on the applicant’s profile, the attorney’s approach, and how quickly supporting documents are provided.

H2: What’s next for Tukki?",blog/article,"The road to $1M in Buffalo TUKKI HEADS TO BUFFALO WITH A $1M WIN The road to $1M in Buffalo Contributor Tukki Reading time 5 mins read Date published Oct 20, 2025 Last week, Tukki was announced as one of the winners of the 43North competition, securing a $1M investment and entry into the 43North accelerator program in the U.S. Every year, 43North brings together different startups to compete for funding, mentorship, and a chance to join Buffalo’s growing tech scene. This year’s cohort drew more than 1,000 applicants, from which Tukki stood out among the final 8 companies pitching live on stage. It is a recognition of how far we have come and a clear sign of what is next. Why Tukki is opting for Buffalo and why now Buffalo is not a random destination. The city has become a rising hub for founders who are building purposeful, impact-driven technology. Its strategic location between the U.S. and Canada, just a few hours from New York, Washington D.C., and Toronto, creates opportunities for collaboration and cross-border growth. Through 43North’s network, Tukki will now be able to expand its B2B efforts while continuing to strengthen the B2C product we have been refining over the past years. “We’ve been testing the platform with B2C clients, iterating every detail, and ensuring that each experience feels personalized and seamless,” says Ramiro Roballos, Tukki’s CEO and co-founder. “Now, we’re ready to scale.” The vision we&#x27;re scaling Tukki’s platform helps founders and professionals navigate the U.S. visa process in a more organized, smooth, and precise way. Unlike traditional law firms that rely on scattered tools and delayed communication, Tukki integrates every step, from attorney reviews to client updates, inside a single transparent system. The goal is simple: make immigration simpler, faster, and more human. “This investment gives us the runway to accelerate what we already know works,” Ramiro adds. “It’s the right moment to grow, to connect with new partners, and to keep building technology that simplifies one of the most complex journeys in a person’s life.” It takes a village Before the final results were announced, Ramiro sent a message to the Tukki team: When Tukki’s name was finally called, the celebration did not stay in Buffalo. From different corners of the world, the team was watching live, refreshing the stream, and sending all-caps messages of joy. Because beyond the funding, this moment is about what it represents: a shared belief that immigration can be reimagined, and a global team working toward that mission together. What’s next for Tukki? Ramiro will soon be heading to Buffalo to start the next chapter with 43North. If you are part of the Buffalo startup ecosystem or nearby, reach out to him on LinkedIn . He would love to connect. And as they say in Buffalo: Go Bills! WE CAN HELP Need more clarity? Find quick answers to frequent visa questions from our legal experts Can my spouse work in the U.S. if I have an H-1B visa? The spouse of an H-1B visa holder can apply for an H-4 visa, but not all H-4 visa holders are eligible to work. Only those whose H-1B spouse has an approved I-140 petition (a step in the Green Card process) can apply for Employment Authorization (EAD). If approved, the H-4 spouse can work for any employer in the U.S. without restrictions. What is the difference between a visa and a green card? A visa allows you to enter and stay in the U.S. for a specific purpose and duration (e.g., work, study, tourism). A green card is permanent residency: it lets you live and work in the U.S. indefinitely, travel more freely, and eventually apply for citizenship. What happens if my visa petition gets denied? You can always reapply, and many cases get approved on a second attempt, even with the same evidence, because decisions can vary between officers. There is no “blacklist.” However, if your denial was for a green card petition, it may affect future applications for nonimmigrant visas (since immigrant intent might be established). It’s important to carefully evaluate strategy before filing an immigrant petition. Can I continue working while my O-1 extension is pending? Yes. If your extension is filed before your current O-1 expires, you are allowed to keep working for up to 240 days while USCIS processes the case. What happens if my O-1 employer goes out of business? You generally lose status once the employment ends, but you may use the 60-day grace period to find a new sponsor and file a new petition. However, since USCIS has started using its discretion to reduce or even eliminate the grace period in some cases it’s more important than ever to act quickly and consult with legal counsel.

But the US immigration system presented a different kind of challenge. For Camila, the opportunity arose to expand her company’s presence in the US, and securing an O-1 visa became her top priority. Navigating the complex immigration process was simplified thanks to the innovative platform and dedicated team she discovered through a previous visa petitioner. How did this visa hopeful find the right fit? As a startup founder, Camila is adept at managing high-pressure situations, but the intricacies of the US immigration process presented unique challenges. The O-1A visa required extensive documentation, including letters from experts and proof of her extraordinary achievements. Her decision to partner with Tukki came after a trusted referral, and the choice was solidified after her first meeting with the team. “From the first meeting, I felt a connection,” says Camila. “Tukki’s team understood my needs and made the process feel approachable and well-organized.” User-centric care for US visa applications In an interview with our team, Camila shared the reasons she chose Tukki to manage her O-1A visa process. Empathetic support : Camila valued the consistent care and responsiveness of Tukki’s team. “Whenever I felt lost, someone was always there to help me out—sometimes responding within minutes. That kind of support made all the difference.” Streamlined process : Tukki’s platform simplified the application process by providing clear steps and real-time feedback. “I didn’t even see the time pass. The platform made it clear what I needed to do next, and I didn’t have to figure everything out on my own.” Stress-free feedback : Quick feedback and transparency helped Camila stay organized and focused. “When I submitted something, I’d get quick feedback—whether it was approved or needed improvement. That organization saved me so much time.” What did the O-1A visa process entail? The O-1A visa requires applicants to demonstrate extraordinary ability in their field. For Camila, that meant documenting Domu’s fintech impact and her leadership achievements. For this, “the platform was a game changer,” affirms Camila. “Everything I needed—documents, timelines, feedback—was organized in one place. It was simple to track progress and know what came next.” A premium immigration experience “Immigration processes can be so stressful, but Tukki really cared about me and my experience. They were there for me at every turn, making sure I felt supported.” The combination of cutting-edge technology and compassionate service was what stood out for Camila, which is no surprise to Tukki’s team since fast responses and an efficient platform were huge parts of the product design process. Visa applications can be smooth and should feel like an empowering experience. Empowered to build Domu’s US presence With her O-1A visa approved, Camila is now settled in San Francisco with her husband and their beloved husky. She’s excited to expand Domu’s US client base and foster relationships within the fintech ecosystem. “Being closer to our US clients will make a huge difference for Domu. The relationships we build in person will take our service to the next level .” In fact, Camila’s positive experience with Tukki has inspired her to bring the platform to her team as they navigate their own immigration processes: “Tukki made such a difference for me. I’m confident they’ll do the same for my team.” Whether you’re a visionary founder like Camila or a professional seeking new opportunities, Tukki ensures you have the support you need to succeed.

But if you’re in the US on a temporary visa, what happens when the clock starts ticking toward the expiration date of your current status? If you’re within a year of your visa’s expiration, it’s time to act. Here’s when to get started and how to navigate the process. US visa transitions take an unknown amount of time This isn’t your first visa so you know that changing or extending a temporary visa involves more than filling out forms—though that part can be time-consuming! Visa petitioning is a complex process that requires preparation, documentation, and, often, navigating government processing delays. For example, Requests for Evidence (RFEs) to provide more proof of your eligibility can extend a timeline by weeks or even months. Depending on the type of visa or US green card you’re transitioning to, you should budget time to meet with your immigration lawyer and gather the necessary evidence to make a strong petition. Letters of recommendation, proof of achievements, and other documentation aren’t built overnight. 12 months aren’t as long as they seem One year might sound like plenty of time, but here’s the reality: Processing times are unpredictable. The US immigration system often faces backlogs, so what’s listed as “typical processing time” may not reflect real-time delays or extenuating circumstances on temporary visa renewals. Preparation eats into your timeline. From collecting evidence to consulting with immigration lawyers, you might need months to ensure everything is ready to submit even if you work with a full legal team . You risk overstaying extensions and having to leave the US. Extensions and transitions aren’t guaranteed. Even with a strong case, immigration authorities can take time to approve—or question—your petition. Starting early buffers any unexpected hurdles. The last thing you want is to have to uproot your life due to red tape and bureaucratic delays. A visa timeline calculator can help Planning your next steps can feel overwhelming, but that’s where tools like this timeline and visa calculator come in. It’s designed to give you a clear picture of what to expect for your specific visa or US green card process, including how long each step typically takes, verified by US immigration lawyers. Whether you’re thinking about transitioning to a US green card or extending your current visa, this tool can help you identify when to start and avoid rushing critical steps. Proactive action = peace of mind The earlier you start, the more control you’ll have over your immigration journey, especially because a consultation with an immigration lawyer can give you a roadmap for improving your profile , so when it’s time to apply, you’re ready. There are several steps you can take to improve your eligibility, but some can take months—so it’s better to know in advance and plan ahead. Moreover, waiting too long can lead to last-minute stress, rushed applications, or even gaps in your legal status. By taking action now, you’ll have time to: Build a strong, well-documented petition. Avoid unnecessary premium processing fees. Navigate challenges, including RFEs, without rushing. What’s your next step? If you’re within a year of your visa’s expiration, schedule a consultation with Tukki’s legal team to explore your options, plan your timeline, and get the support you need for a seamless visa transition. Your future in the US doesn’t have to be uncertain—start early, plan ahead, and choose Tukki’s immigration lawyer to make it a premium experience. WE CAN HELP Need more clarity? Find quick answers to frequent visa questions from our legal experts Does having patents help in EB-1A or O-1 petitions? Yes. Patents that have been commercialized or frequently cited can help demonstrate original contributions. However, simply holding a patent that has not been applied or recognized by others in the field is not sufficient to establish this category. What are the main eligibility requirements for an H-1B visa? To qualify for an H-1B visa, you must have a job offer from a U.S. employer for a specialty occupation, meaning a role that requires highly specialized knowledge and at least a bachelor’s degree or higher in a directly related field. If your degree is from outside the U.S., it must be evaluated for equivalency. Additionally, the employer must comply with all Labor Condition Application (LCA) requirements, including paying at least the prevailing wage set by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) for that occupation and location. Do I need a job offer or employer sponsorship for an EB-2 NIW? No, one of the main advantages of the EB-2 NIW is that you can self-petition, meaning you do not need a U.S. employer to sponsor you or go through the labor certification (PERM) process, which is typically a lengthy and complex requirement for employer-sponsored Green Cards. Instead, you must prove that your work is in the national interest of the U.S. and that waiving the job offer requirement would benefit the country. If you are physically in the U.S., can you work for a job abroad? Only if you hold a visa or work authorization that allows you to work in the U.S. If your status does not permit employment, you cannot legally work—even for a foreign company paying you abroad. Even with work authorization, it must cover the type of employment you intend to do. For example, an O-1 visa through a U.S. agent may allow you to work with multiple companies, while an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) provides broader flexibility. What happens if a qualified U.S. worker applies during recruitment? The employer cannot continue with the PERM for that position. There are no exceptions or appeals. The employer may restart recruitment after six months.

A real look inside the role of an immigration lawyer Contributor Nadine Reading time 3 mins read Date published Dec 3, 2024 Immigration law might seem like a clear-cut field where rules are applied uniformly, but the reality is far more complex. To get an insider’s perspective on what makes this job both challenging and unpredictable, I spoke with José Carlos de Wit , an experienced attorney working in US immigration services since 2014 and practicing law for longer. A game of chance: The role of human bias Even the most airtight immigration case can face unexpected hurdles. According to José: ""The perfect candidate with the perfect case can get the wrong officer and get the wrong outcome."" He highlights that success of a US green card or visa isn’t solely about meeting the requirements. The adjudication process introduces an element of unpredictability. ""You might do an excellent job, but the other part of a case&#x27;s success is just who is reviewing it. Human bias does exist, and sometimes adjudicators struggle to keep up with policy changes."" Policy updates, varying interpretations, and individual discretion can all influence the outcome of a case. What else makes working in US immigration services more challenging? The relentless pace of immigration law Immigration law evolves rapidly, often leaving little time for attorneys, applicants, or even adjudicators to catch up. What was true six months ago might no longer apply, making it critical for immigration lawyers to stay ahead of the curve. On the other hand… José puts it bluntly: ""Immigration works in dog years."" The processes move slower than we all hope and expect, so you can never start planning for a green card or visa process too soon. Navigating the maze of US green card and visa agencies Immigration in the US isn’t governed by one central body. Instead, multiple agencies with distinct roles and often conflicting approaches manage the process of US green cards and visa. ""There are three large agencies dealing with immigration in the US—DOS, DHS, and DOL—which in turn are subdivided into sub-agencies including USCIS , ICE, and CBP. They all have their own rulebook, and they change without warning,” says José. This fragmentation can result in confusion and frustration for applicants and attorneys alike. Equally concerned with this complexity, Tukki faced this issue head-on, creating technology to ease the job of the immigration lawyer as well as visa hopefuls. Read more about those US visa services here , if you’re curious. Unlike other areas of law with comprehensive codes, José sees immigration law as a large tangle, with legislation, guidelines, and administrative interpretations in multiple places. ""There’s no &#x27;Bible&#x27; for immigration law—there&#x27;s a patchwork of acts, manuals, and memos that may or may not apply depending on the officer and the day."" This lack of consistency means immigration lawyers must navigate each case with precision, creativity, and adaptability, and of course keep some Tylenol on hand for the headaches! Behind the scenes of visa applicant advocacy For immigration lawyers, the work of US green card and visa applications isn’t just about filing forms or attending interviews. It’s about staying resilient in the face of uncertainty and working hard for clients who may feel the system is stacked against them. José’s insights reveal the human side of immigration law: a field where success depends not just on knowledge but on persistence and the ability to adapt to an ever-changing landscape. For those seeking US immigration services, I hope this behind-the-scenes look serves as a reminder to choose representation that understands the system&#x27;s complexities and advocates fiercely on your behalf.

Find quick answers to frequent visa questions from our legal experts Can my spouse work in the U.S. if I have an H-1B visa? The spouse of an H-1B visa holder can apply for an H-4 visa, but not all H-4 visa holders are eligible to work. Only those whose H-1B spouse has an approved I-140 petition (a step in the Green Card process) can apply for Employment Authorization (EAD). If approved, the H-4 spouse can work for any employer in the U.S. without restrictions. Does being published in major media help in O-1 or EB-1A applications? Yes. Evidence of press coverage—especially in reputable, independent outlets—is strong proof of recognition in your field. However, not all articles are born equal, and some are far more relevant than others. The article should be mostly about you and your work, have a listed author, and date. What kind of evidence strengthens an EB-2 NIW petition? A strong EB-2 NIW petition must demonstrate that you have the expertise and experience to advance your endeavor and that your work has substantial merit and national importance. Evidence may include receiving awards, publishing research, holding patents, and having relevant work experience in your field. Support from employers, investors, or institutions can further strengthen your case. Additional factors include serving as a judge of others' work, holding memberships in prestigious organizations, and being featured in media coverage. The more solid and well-documented your evidence, the stronger your petition. What is “dual intent” and which visas allow it? Dual intent means you can hold a temporary visa while also intending to apply for permanent residency (a green card). The H-1B and L-1 visas are true dual intent visas. Most others, such as B-1/B-2, E-2, and F-1, do not permit dual intent, so pursuing a green card from those visas can create complications. The O-1 is a special case: it is not a dual intent visa by law, but in practice, both USCIS and the Department of State usually treat it as if it were. Is it mandatory to hire a lawyer for an O-1 or EB-1A petition? No. Technically you can self-file (for EB-1A) or have an employer file without an attorney. However, due to the complexity of the evidence, most applicants strongly benefit from legal representation.

From optimizing business strategies to optimized visa petitioning Contributor Tukki Reading time 4 mins read Date published Nov 28, 2024 Javier Méndez is a visionary strategist and business leader whose work has had profound impact, particularly in Colombia. His contributions in the public sector have been influential, he worked closely with the Colombian government and the Ministry of Finance during critical moments in recent history. However, Javier didn’t see it that way himself , until he applied to MIT and was accepted to an MBA program. Today, the epitome of desirable immigration, Javier holds an EB-1A which will allow him to remain in Miami—the US government’s designated CleanTech hub—and expand his work with renewable energy sources through entrepreneurship. Here’s how he secured his extraordinary ability visa. How did Javier know the EB-1A visa was right for him? Sometimes, our own extraordinary abilities are less clear to us than to others. This was the case for Javier, but Tukki’s US immigration lawyers could see the potential for a successful visa application before the process started. For context, Javier has deep expertise managing a portfolio of significant assets, developing business strategies, and developing sustainable solutions particularly in the energy sector. Understandably, his sights were set on a visa process that matched his drive for impact. For his journey, he chose Tukki, and for his visa, the EB-1A. Javier’s reasons for choosing the EB-1A visa Extraordinary achievements : Identifying that Javier’s track record aligns with the EB-1A visa criteria through leadership roles and contributions to his field, Tukki’s team felt confident his accomplishments demonstrated national acclaim. Desire for independence : The EB-1A visa allows applicants to self-petition, meaning Javier didn’t need an employer to sponsor him. This route appeals to people with a strong professional reputation who want flexibility in their career. Alignment with goals : Javier could see the EB-1A was the best pathway to continue his work in the US and go on to build a business that would make even more impact on the world. Expert advice : Javier consulted with the immigration experts at Tukki, assessed his eligibility and match his achievements to the right extraordinary ability visa . What did the EB-1A visa application entail? The US immigration process is one of the more daunting systems that professionals might face during their career. Mergers, layoffs, and buy-outs can pale in comparison to the complexities of apply for an extraordinary ability visa in the US. It requires meticulous attention to detail, as well as timely responses from specialist US immigration lawyers to ensure the applicants unique qualifications will be highlighted. Javier specifically needed to compile documentation that captured the breadth of his impact , from his economic policies to his technical expertise in energy management. Given the stakes, he needed an immigration partner he could trust to keep things on track, and the team+tech he chose was Tukki. Javier’s premium visa experience The premium technology and service model resonated with Javier. As a high-stakes application and a driven applicant, he benefited from the level of transparency Tukki could provide. ""The technology was super useful, especially for tracking each document and requirement—it made everything easier to follow and ensured I didn’t miss any steps."" Javier appreciated the platform’s simplicity and clarity, which helped him stay aware of each milestone in the process and what would be required next. Beyond the tech, Javier praised Tukki’s support team. “The process was super fast. Any time I needed support or had a concern, there was always someone to talk to,” Javier shared, reflecting on the sense of security he felt throughout the application journey. The journey through the immigration platform With Tukki’s help, Javier was able to manage the EB-1A visa application process efficiently, ensuring that no document, piece of evidence, or expert letter fell through the cracks. ""It’s impressive how easy it was to track progress and know exactly what was needed next—Tukki kept everything organized and moving forward."" Tukki’s system is designed for accountability and traceability. This not only ensures that every aspect of a case is well documented, it helps petitioners feel supported. When Javier’s visa was approved in eight days with premium processing , he shared just how meaningful this achievement was to him. “I thought receiving the visa approval would feel as good as getting into MIT. But receiving my EB-1A felt like 10x that happiness level!” 10x happiness to 10x his impact Today, with his extraordinary ability visa secured, Javier is fully immersed in Florida&#x27;s business ecosystem, where he has access to numerous opportunities and strategic partnerships. With a career marked by his roles as a portfolio manager, strategist, and advisor to companies undergoing turnaround, he brings a unique set of skills to the table. His expertise in optimizing business operations and restructuring organizations now enables him to apply his strategic insight and experience to one of the most dynamic and rapidly evolving markets in the world. Make sure you find the right partner for complex immigration pathways. Tukki’s seamless technology, hands-on support, and adaptability is the perfect match for dynamic, accomplished leaders looking for a premium immigration experience. WE CAN HELP Need more clarity? Find quick answers to frequent visa questions from our legal experts What happens if a qualified U.S. worker applies during recruitment? The employer cannot continue with the PERM for that position. There are no exceptions or appeals. The employer may restart recruitment after six months. What’s the difference between “extraordinary ability” and “exceptional ability”? Extraordinary ability is the language you must use in O-1 and EB-1A cases, and it means you are among the very top in your field. Exceptional ability (EB-2 NIW wording) means you have expertise significantly above the average but not necessarily at the very top. How long does it take to get an O-1 visa approved? With premium processing, most O-1 petitions are decided within 15 business days. Without premium processing, a decision can take several months, depending on USCIS workload. The preparation stage—collecting evidence, drafting recommendation letters, and organizing the petition—typically takes anywhere from 6 weeks to 6 months, depending on the applicant’s profile, the attorney’s approach, and how quickly supporting documents are provided. Is it better to adjust status or do consular processing for the green card application? It depends on your priorities: • Adjustment of Status (AOS): Lets you stay in the U.S. while applying even if your visa expires, often faster, and allows you to request work authorization while waiting. However, you typically cannot travel during the process (unless under certain specific circumstances, such as having a valid H-1B or L-1). • Consular Processing: Usually better if travel flexibility is a priority, but requires attending an interview at a U.S. consulate abroad. Can I extend my stay in the U.S. without leaving the country? Yes, in some cases. You can request an extension or change of status with USCIS before your authorized stay expires. Approval is not guaranteed, and it depends on your visa type and compliance with U.S. immigration rules.

With overwhelming demand according to 2023 data , the first step to a green card needs to be knowing how to submit the most competitive, competent application possible. You likely know that submitting a green card application can lead to permanent residency, the ability to work, and the pathway to citizenship—this coveted permanent residency status is known as a green card. In this article, we’ll focus on the what you need to know about obtaining the ability to live and work permanently in the US. Visit our blog on nonimmigrant visas for more on temporary residency permissions. Diving into the reason you’re here, below is a list of the bare minimum you need to gather and do, in order to apply for a US green card. Basic eligibility criteria for a US green card Clean criminal background and immigration history Passing a medical checkup and current vaccines Generally, having an approved employment-based or family-based green card petition More criteria apply that are specific to different types of green card, as follows. Types of US green cards Getting a US green card is a long process and it can be confusing to figure out which type of green card is right for you, to know where to start. We broke down the main types of green cards, focusing on those based on family connections, employment, and a handful of other unique situations. Family-based green cards: Family-based green cards are among the most common ways to gain US residency. These are generally split into two groups: immediate relatives and family preference categories. Immediate relatives: These green cards are for the closest family members of US citizens, including spouses, unmarried children under 21, and parents. Since there’s no limit on the number of green cards given out in this category each year, it’s often the quickest way to get a green card. Family preference categories: These are for more distant relatives, including siblings and married children of US citizens, or certain relatives of permanent residents. This category is divided into four preference levels, each with a specific number of green cards available annually. First preference (F1) are unmarried sons and daughters of US citizens who are over 21 years of age. Second preference (F2A) are spouses and children of lawful permanent residents, who are unmarried and under 21 years of age. Second preference (F2B) refers to unmarried sons and daughters who are over 21 years of age. Third preference (F3) are married sons and daughters of US citizens. Fourth preference (F4) are the brothers and sisters of US citizens and are over 21 years old. To figure out where you stand, you’ll need to check the Visa Bulletin , which is updated every month. Employment-based green cards: If you’re looking to stay in the US through your business, investment, or profession, employment-based green cards are your best bet. These are split into several preference categories, depending on the type of job or level of expertise you have. EB-1: 40,000 EB-1 US visas can be emitted per year, and any left over will roll over into the EB-2 quota. This is for people with extraordinary skills, like top scientists, artists, or business executives (EB-1A). It’s also open to outstanding professors and researchers (EB-1B), as well as certain high-level managers from multinational companies (EB-1C). This category is prioritized, so it rarely has a backlog for most countries. EB-2: 40,000 EB-1 US visas can be emitted per year, and any left over will roll over into the EB-3 quota. Professionals with advanced degrees or exceptional abilities can apply under this category. It also includes the National Interest Waiver, which lets you skip the usual job offer and labor certification if your work benefits the US and you’re skilled in what the job requires. EB-3: 40,000 EB-1 US visas can be emitted per year, and any left over will roll over into the EB-4 quota. This category covers skilled workers, professionals, and other workers. Since it’s a broader category, it typically has longer waiting periods compared to EB-1 and EB-2. EB-4: 10,000 EB-1 US visas can be emitted per year, and any left over will roll over into the EB-5 quota. Special immigrants, like religious workers or employees of foreign service posts, fall into this category. EB-5: 10,000 EB-1 US visas can be emitted per year. If you’ve got the funds to invest in a new US business and create jobs, the EB-5 category might be for you. It’s designed for investors who can make a significant impact on the US economy, by investing at least $800,000 into an existing or new business. Diversity lottery green cards: The Diversity Visa (DV) Lottery, or Green Card Lottery, is a unique program aimed at increasing the diversity of immigrants in the US Each year, 50,000 diversity visas are awarded to individuals from countries with low immigration rates to the UUS Eligibility Requirements: To qualify, you need to be from an eligible country and meet certain education or work experience criteria. Some countries are excluded from the program each year, based on their immigration numbers. Application Process: The application process is online, and you need to submit your entry during the specified registration period which is usually in October. Winners are picked randomly, but winning the lottery doesn’t automatically mean you’ll get a green card. You still have to meet all the eligibility criteria and complete the application process before the fiscal year ends in September. Other categories: Beyond the common family-based and employment-based green cards, there are a few other categories for special situations: Refugees and asylum S¿seekers: If you’ve been granted asylum or refugee status in the US, you can apply for a green card after one year. This path offers protection to those escaping persecution in their home countries. Special Immigrant Juveniles (SIJ): This category is for children in the US who have been abused, abandoned, or neglected and need protection. U Visa and T visa holders: If you’re a victim of certain crimes or human trafficking and have helped law enforcement, you might be eligible for a green card after living in the US for a while. Other special cases: There are also green cards for long-term residents, certain Cuban citizens, and individuals who qualify under specific legal provisions. Getting a green card is a big deal, but knowing which type is right for you makes the process smoother. Whether you’re relying on family ties, a job offer, or a unique circumstance, there’s likely a path that fits your situation. Keep these categories in mind as you plan your journey toward permanent residency in the US. Application process Here’s an overview of the steps you’ll need to follow to apply for a US green card. Note that these petitions are particularly difficult to file successfully without a lawyer or immigration technology . Determine your eligibility: Identify the correct green card category (family-based, employment-based, etc.) for your situation using the list above and an assessment tool . Conduct a personalized analysis with an experienced legal team to verify your eligibility and understand the US visa process. File the visa petition : Form I-130 and required documentation to prove your family ties for family-based petition. Form I-140 and specific documentation required for your selected employment-based petition. Form I-526 and required documentation for your investment-based petition. Obtain your priority date to track your place in line for a visa. File your green card application: Once you receive approval for your visa petition and your priority date is current, you can then apply for your green card. Your spouse and children under 21 can also apply for their green card at this point. There are 2 paths to obtaining your green card: Consular processing and adjustment of status. Adjustment of status: This is only available for those who are already living in the US with a valid visa status. Note that you won’t be able to leave the US from the moment you submit your application until you get your green card (except for candidates under H-1B, L-1, or their dependents). You can also file for a travel document that will enable you to travel even before getting your green card. Fill out a Form I-485 . Fill in your personal information, immigration history, and employment details. Include required supporting documents, which will include your birth certificate, passport photos, and proof of lawful entry, among other documents. Consular processing: This is for visa applicants who are outside the US. Fill out a DS-260 , officially called the “immigrant visa electronic application.” Fill in your personal information, immigration history, and employment details. Include the required supporting documents, which will include your birth certificate, and passport photos, among other documents. Apply at a US consulate or embassy in your home country. Interviews and medical examinations: Interviews at the consulate may be required for all applicants. Note that USCIS sometimes waives the interview for adjustment of status processes. Undergo a medical examination: To ensure public health safety, this must be completed by a USCIS-approved civil surgeon . Submit the completed Form I-693 as part of your application. These are the logistics you’ll need to go through. We’ve kept it as simple as possible to help you prepare for the process. Approach it with patience. Wondering how you can increase your US green card chances? Tips for a successful green card application Follow this advice for a smooth US green card application. 1. Organize your documentation well: Keep all your paperwork organized by creating separate folders for each document type (e.g., identification, financial records, forms). Maintain copies of every document you submit, including receipts and notices from USCIS. Double-check that your application is complete before submission. Missing documents can lead to delays or rejections. 2. Deadlines are not flexible: Always adhere to deadlines for submitting forms and responding to requests from USCIS. Keep a close eye on your priority dates, especially if you’re applying under a category with limited visa availability. Missing these deadlines can set back your entire application. 3. It’s worth accessing legal assistance: Identify which green card you’re best suited to, according to your profile, situation and experience with the Visa Match tool. Consult with an immigration attorney before navigating the complex green card process. A US immigration lawyer can help ensure you meet all legal requirements and avoid common pitfalls that could result in delays or denials. They can also offer personalized advice based on your specific situation. 4. Prepare for the interview for consistency: Start by reviewing your entire application to ensure consistency during the interview. Practice answering common questions, such as those about your background, employment, or family ties. Be prepared to demonstrate your eligibility with confidence, bringing any additional documentation that might support your case. While the process can be challenging, proper preparation and understanding will keep the anxiety at bay, as will knowing what’s happening at every point in the process. That’s achievable with the right US immigration services, lawyers, and technology. Contact us for personalized guidance on your US green card. WE CAN HELP Need more clarity? Find quick answers to frequent visa questions from our legal experts Do O-1 visas have a maximum number of years like H-1B? No. O-1 visas can be renewed indefinitely in increments (usually 1–3 years), as long as you continue to meet the criteria. Do I need a job offer or employer sponsorship for an EB-2 NIW? No, one of the main advantages of the EB-2 NIW is that you can self-petition, meaning you do not need a U.S. employer to sponsor you or go through the labor certification (PERM) process, which is typically a lengthy and complex requirement for employer-sponsored Green Cards. Instead, you must prove that your work is in the national interest of the U.S. and that waiving the job offer requirement would benefit the country. Who must prove ability to pay the prevailing wage from the PERM and how? The employer must demonstrate ability to pay the wage from the PERM priority date onward using tax returns, annual reports, audited financials, or payroll records. This is a common source of I-140 delays or denials. Does having patents help in EB-1A or O-1 petitions? Yes. Patents that have been commercialized or frequently cited can help demonstrate original contributions. However, simply holding a patent that has not been applied or recognized by others in the field is not sufficient to establish this category. Can I continue working while my O-1 extension is pending? Yes. If your extension is filed before your current O-1 expires, you are allowed to keep working for up to 240 days while USCIS processes the case.

The Tukkiversary Pitch Competition Contributor Nadine Heir Reading time 4 mins read Date published Oct 4, 2024 Have you heard? Tukki is celebrating its first year of serving US visa hopefuls with a generous giveaway to those who’ve supported the company in its initial growth phase—in the official Tukkiversary month! To get down to why Ramiro Roballos and Saveliy Vasilev wanted to host a Pitch Competition for founders, I interviewed the two founders of Tukki about their own experiences and what led up to the social initiative. Here’s what they had to say. What would winning a free visa process have meant to you when you were starting your journey, and how do you see that impacting others now? Ramiro: A huge amount, I couldn’t start my business until I had the green card. It would have given me freedom, and peace of mind, especially to know the cost was taken care of independently of whether I was successful or not. We’re here to revolutionize the industry, and it’s going to be about more than improving the process, we think there should be action behind it that involves the whole community. Where did this whole idea for a US visa Pitch Competition start? Ramiro: One day, I realized our mission to transform the US immigration experience was about more than just improving the process—it was about reimagining the entire approach. We had already begun innovating with tools like our visa match and pricing calculator, and it became clear that offering a free immigration process through a pitch competition was the perfect next step in supporting immigrants and enhancing their experience. Saveliy: It’s all about opportunities. I was fortunate enough to have met many people who created opportunities for me — be it via a simple intro email, accepting me as a doctorate student, or endorsing me for a career move while with McKinsey. In retrospect, these people changed my life for the better. It’s time to pay it forward, and Tukki is the perfect vehicle for this mission. We don’t know how the lives of the winners will change, but there’s a good chance of it being significant and for the better. That’s our reason for doing this! Ramiro: The votes of confidence, the referrals, as well as the teachings we’ve been given along the way mean so much. That’s why I’ve been setting up initiatives to give back , such as free mentorship to other startup founders. So many people advised me over the years, on everything from how to incorporate a company to when to kill a fevered product vision, that I know the startup ecosystem is full of people who’ll respond “yes” to requests for help. Why startup founders? Saveliy: Our current focus is on extraordinary ability visas, for which the process is complex. Entrepreneurs are those extraordinary people, with the potential to generate great value for the society, and are going through a lot running their companies. That’s why we want to facilitate the access to startups first—we know from experience how hard both running a business and applying for a green card can be. Ramiro : It’s incredibly difficult to be a founder, it requires tons of focus and battling everything that distracts you takes discipline. Applying for a visa or green card alone is a time and energy-drain, so we think making that process simpler is the right way to give back. So much innovation that happens in the world come from startups. So we see Tukki’s Pitch Competition as a way to also contribute to the global innovation system. Saveliy : There are so many startups out there that could expand and grow professionally. We know that, via this competition, we’ll be bringing standout candidates to the US who could do great things, given the opportunity. Startups always need fertile ground on which to sow their seeds, and allowing them to reach the US could be a game-changer for the winning founders. Ramiro : With this Pitch Competition , we’re sending out a signal that we’re here for the startup ecosystem, we want to keep changing peoples’ lives, and support founders while they innovate. Did this pique your interest? You can apply during the month of October 2024 here ! WE CAN HELP Need more clarity? Find quick answers to frequent visa questions from our legal experts What are the total costs of US immigration including legal fees, USCIS fees and any other payments? The total cost for US immigration varies depending on the type of visa and the number of applicants. On average, the all-inclusive cost ranges from $10,000 to $15,000 for a work visa and from $14,000 to $20,000 for a green card. For a family of four, the cost might range from $10,000 to $15,000 for a work visa and from $14,000 to $30,000 for a green card. To know the specific cost of your visa or green card application, consult our visa pricing calculator . Can the employer change the job description or salary after recruitment begins? No. Once recruitment starts, the job requirements and prevailing wage cannot be changed without restarting the entire process from the beginning. What determines whether a case becomes EB-2 or EB-3? The job requirements define the category, not the candidate’s resume. EB-2 applies if the job requires a Master’s degree or Bachelor’s + 5 years of progressive experience. EB-3 applies to Bachelor-level roles, skilled workers (2+ years experience), or other workers. Do O-1 visas have a maximum number of years like H-1B? No. O-1 visas can be renewed indefinitely in increments (usually 1–3 years), as long as you continue to meet the criteria. Is it possible to re-apply to the USCIS if your application to the O-1A or EB-1A visas is rejected? Yes, you can reapply as many times as you wish. However, bear in mind that when you submit a green card petition or it’s submitted on your behalf, immigration authorities may sometimes see this as an indication that you plan to live in the US permanently (immigrant intent). This is incompatible with a key requirement for most temporary visas, which must express an intent to relocate to the US temporarily only. If you plan to, or need to file a temporary visa application after filing an EB-1A application, this may affect your eligibility to renew or obtain your temporary visa. Rules around resubmissions are nuanced, so it is advisable to consult with an experienced immigration attorney to understand all the implications.

How to skip the headaches if you meet the O-1A visa requirements Contributor Tukki Reading time 3 mins read Date published Sep 24, 2024 Most US visa applicants are anxious about starting their O-1A visa process, and from what Carlos Mejia had heard from friends, dealing with traditional law firms was a nightmare. ""I heard from a colleague that the experience with normal US immigration lawyers was horrible. You get no feedback, sending documents is confusing, and understanding the thresholds of the criteria to obtain a visa becomes a blur."" A lack of transparency and communication is concerning , especially with such a complex immigration system. The O-1A is an extraordinary ability visa, for individuals who have demonstrated extraordinary ability in the fields of science, education, business, or athletics. Carlos certainly had extraordinary ability, but wasn’t sure where to begin, which US immigration lawyers to trust, or how much the process would cost. Second-hand accounts of nerve-wracking US visa application Carlos knew that applying for a US visa could be a long and nerve-wracking process, and knew that few people were prepared for just how intricate it could be. His friend, Akrisht Pandey , who had gone through the same process with another law firm, had struggled to get answers and was constantly unsure of where his case stood. Carlos feared the same , knowing a lack of transparency would add to the stress. That’s when Carlos led Akrisht to Tukki’s legal platform. Even though Carlos hadn’t yet engaged any law firm, he was impressed by what he heard about Tukki and how it contrasted with his friends’ previous experiences. After Akrisht confirmed Carlos’ suspicions, he decided to use Tukki as well. Carlos’ first interaction with Tukki’s CEO set the stage for a more reassuring journey. “Ramiro’s approach felt very personal. Even at the beginning, I felt at ease because Ramiro was transparent about which US visas were options for me and what the different steps would look like.” Still, gathering the necessary evidence for the O-1A visa criteria would be a daunting task. Carlos felt the pressure to ensure all his documentation was in order. ""It took more time than I’d have liked to gather all the evidence, but Tukki gave me the reassurance I needed to stay on track."" Who can you trust with an O-1A visa application? Working with Tukki was a completely different experience to what Carlos expected from the US visa application process. Rather than dealing with scattered paperwork and unclear timelines as he’d been warned about traditional law firms, Carlos had access to a central platform where he could track his case, upload and review documents , and be sure he was submitting everything correctly. ""The Tukki team’s involvement plus the tech platform where you&#x27;re able to track your own process were key to how smooth it went,"" Carlos says. The personalized support from Tukki’s team were the main difference. ""I had calls of one or two hours in which we were looking at the documents, looking at the letters, reinforcing them together. We went back over my past achievements, reviewing each piece of evidence I was submitting,"" Carlos explains. This personalized attention helped him feel confident that his case was as strong as possible. Since US visa applicants need to share extensive amounts of information with their legal team, it seems appropriate that their legal team offer the same level of transparency into process times and paralegal work . This, standard procedure for Tukki, was how Carlos could understand not just the legal aspects of his US visa application but also his role in making sure it succeeded. “ Tukki offered me all the tools and the time I needed . But it wasn’t just up to them. I had to make sure I was putting in the effort to gather quality documents and evidence,” he reflects. The success of each application hinges on the close partnership between a visa hopeful and their legal team. Partnering to meet all the O-1A visa requirements Tukki’s personalized approach, legal expertise, and technology teamed up with Carlos’ hard work— and his O-1A visa was approved in 2024. For Carlos, his US visa application experience was premium and a world apart from what he had heard about traditional immigration law firms. ""The amount of personalization, attention, and immediacy I received was impressive,"" he says. With the help of the US immigration lawyers at Tukki, Carlos navigated the complex US visa process with confidence, all the way through to visa approval.

Find quick answers to frequent visa questions from our legal experts What is EB-1A? A visa for individuals with extraordinary ability. How much documentation do I need to file a visa petition for an EB-1A or O-1A visa? In US immigration processes, your claims must be more likely than not to be true. This means if something appears more true than false, USCIS should accept it as true. To meet this standard, the visa petitioner should provide documents that convincingly support the claim’s validity. For instance, to prove you received VC funding, you could provide signed SAFE agreements with a VC, a published article about your funding round, and documentation about the relevance of the VC. Keep in mind that theory and practice do not always perfectly align. It’s crucial you speak to an experienced legal team to avoid spending time and money on documentation that does not support your case. Is it possible to re-apply to the USCIS if your application to the O-1A or EB-1A visas is rejected? Yes, you can reapply as many times as you wish. However, bear in mind that when you submit a green card petition or it’s submitted on your behalf, immigration authorities may sometimes see this as an indication that you plan to live in the US permanently (immigrant intent). This is incompatible with a key requirement for most temporary visas, which must express an intent to relocate to the US temporarily only. If you plan to, or need to file a temporary visa application after filing an EB-1A application, this may affect your eligibility to renew or obtain your temporary visa. Rules around resubmissions are nuanced, so it is advisable to consult with an experienced immigration attorney to understand all the implications. Can I file for the EB-1A and the Adjustment of Status at the same time? Yes in most cases (when your priority date is current), but we generally advise against it. Filing for Adjustment of Status signals clear immigrant intent. If your EB-1A is denied, it could make obtaining non–dual intent visas (such as E-1 or E-2) more difficult. The safer approach: secure EB-1A approval first, then apply for Adjustment of Status. Can I apply for both the O-1 and EB-1A at the same time? Yes. It’s possible to pursue both strategies simultaneously. However, it’s far more common to apply for the O-1 and then pursue the EB-1A. Many applicants use the O-1 as a “bridge” to work legally in the U.S. while building their profile for the EB-1A. The O-1 is temporary, while the EB-1A leads to permanent residency.

Her goal was to gain more flexibility to travel frequently for business, access economic opportunities, and long-term provide a better education for her children, but she’d never thought she would be eligible for more than a successful US tourist visa application, until nudged. Initially, Natalia began her visa journey with traditional US immigration lawyers, applying for the EB-2 NIW visa. However, she became unsure whether this was the right path for her when noting that the process was largely unpersonalized to her specific case. ""I started my visa application with another firm before getting in touch with Tukki. I was applying to the EB-2 NIW, but I wasn’t confident in the process,"" Natalia told us. ""The first US immigration lawyers I contracted try to fit you into the EB-2 NIW criteria because it’s what’s most scalable for them. They didn&#x27;t do anything wrong but they also didn’t analyze my case in a personalized way.” Doubts arise about EB-2 NIW eligibility As Natalia went deeper into the process, the EB-2 NIW application began to feel more like a one-size-fits-all solution. She started to feel that they hadn’t taken her full potential into account. This left her feeling uncertain about whether she was on the right path. Ultimately, Natalia’s time and resources were at stake, so she wanted a solution that would make her feel secure in the process , confident that her application would truly reflect her qualifications and background. ""The first US visa lawyers I tried didn’t give me the whole picture. I was presented with how my background lined up against one visa option, but no one questioned if it was really the best fit for me."" A tech-enabled alternative for the EB-1A extraordinary ability visa Natalia discovered Tukki through a LinkedIn post and reached out to a former college friend, Saveliy , for advice. Saveliy had founded Tukki since they last spoke, hoping to support US visa hopefuls with their applications through exceptional legal support and a transparent platform . It was just what Natalia was looking for. The shift was immediate once she engaged Tukki. All her options were considered given Natalia’s extraordinary ability, but the team suggested switching to the EB-1A visa after carefully reviewing her case, since it aligned better with her unique qualifications. ""When Tukki started talking to me about my background, I realized I had more than three strong pieces to help me apply for the EB-1A visa. I also came to understand the EB-1A processing time would be faster for my specific case."" Applicants divulge transparently—you deserve the same from your US immigration lawyers Tukki’s personalized, transparent approach gave Natalia the confidence to thank her previous US immigration lawyers for their work and start afresh. Tukki’s platform and team provided a clear roadmap for her application, diving into specific requirements and giving her a detailed pre-screening to ensure she met all EB-1A criteria. Throughout the process, she says she felt fully supported, which is precisely what Tukki’s name means ! ""I felt more confident with Tukki submitting my visa application than the firm I had already hired. I dropped my initial application and started over on this more customized path."" Digital hand-holding matters What stood out to Natalia was not only Tukki’s expertise but their dedication to her personal success achieving the EB-1A green card. The team of paralegals and lawyers treated her case with care, offering her personalized support that made her feel like she was their only client. ""My impression was that I was the only client for them. They knew exactly what they were doing, and they were there for me the entire journey."" Thanks to Tukki’s guidance, Natalia is now well on her way to securing her EB-1A visa. She feels confident that she’s taken the best route, allowing her to achieve her goals of expanding her business and creating a better future for her family. ""Tukki gave me confidence—they were committed to me as if I was their only client. The knowledge and honesty of Tukki’s team made all the difference. "" Happy ending: A premium EB-1A process and experience By taking the time to understand her background and offer honest, expert advice, Tukki’s lawyers and paralegals ensured Natalia applied for the visa that best suited her qualifications. Now, she is closer than ever to fulfilling her dream of working and living in the US. while expanding her business. ""If the team at Tukki proposes something, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s feasible. They do everything in their hands to make it happen."" We’re thrilled that with the right team by her side, Natalia was able to file for her US visa with the premium experience curated by Tukki.

H2: Tukki today",blog/article,"Conducting the immigration experience — Ramiro Roballos&#x27; journey from symphony to startup US IMMIGRATION, BUT SIMPLE. Conducting the immigration experience — Ramiro Roballos&#x27; journey from symphony to startup Contributor Nadine Heir Reading time 8 mins read Date published Jun 30, 2024 Tap into the wealth of experience and unique perspective that having previously worked as a McKinsey consultant and an orchestra conductor brings to this story. In this exclusive Q&A, Ramiro Roballos , CEO of Tukki, delves into the pivotal moments and motivations that led him to create the groundbreaking platform turning the US immigration process into a premium experience. Drawing from his own challenging experiences with immigration and his passion for technology, Ramiro shares the journey from his initial ""Eureka"" moment to winning a Hackathon in Austin and partnering with former colleagues to build a solution that addresses the real pain points of migrants. This in-depth conversation reveals not only the origins of Tukki but also the mission-driven approach that continues to shape its development and impact following Ramiro’s interview with me, your line into Tukki&#x27;s secrets, Nadine Heir . Saying yes to the plunge Q: Where did the “Tukki Eureka” moment come from? A: I’d been working at McKinsey in Miami before, a truly consuming job where I learned an immense amount, fed my MBA experience, and flexed my business muscles. I had an itch to start something of my own though, to learn how to code, and get back to leading something bigger than me — like I did as an orchestra conductor and at my music school in Argentina — and knew I couldn’t do that while working as a consultant. So I took the plunge, I left the company with no plan B. I was saying “yes” to all the potential ideas and adventures that crossed my path. I had continued studying programming on weekends and in May of 2023, I went to a Techstars Hackathon in Austin to present myself as a programmer, not a McKinsey consultant for the first time. So you see, I already had this idea in mind. I knew there was a gap in the market because I’d been through the literal nightmare that was US immigration in the most traditional sense. It’s so old school and has not advanced at the rate of other industries that grow technology. I was ready to change that. Q: Did the Hackathon reveal demand in the market for your idea? A: In short, yes. Perhaps it was a sign that another group of programmers wanted to do something similar. We teamed up and pitched an AI-driven solution to immigration headaches and, out of around 30 teams, we won! I took this as a sign that the idea was more than valid. I was already talking to an old colleague from McKinsey, Saviley Vasilev, and essentially we decided to become partners, and founded Tukki . Losing 5 months, but gaining a mission Q: So tell us, what convinced you and your co-founder to join forces on this mission? A: The initial idea was to create a platform that would help lawyers. However, in-depth research revealed that lawyers weren’t struggling with the process as much — to a certain extent, it “worked” for them. But it didn’t work for migrants. In my own experience, I’ve never been more frustrated with a process. I was super keen to achieve my green card in 2021 when I was still at McKinsey, so was never taking longer than a 24h to complete my tasks as they came to me. Every copy, every form I had to get hold of, I had it within a day. But the lawyers I worked with would take 7 to 10 days to respond at each step. Even my critical questions would receive a sort of canned response, late, and unspecific. I lost 5 months of my life in the filing process. Then, the government took another 18 months to give me a response. Now, when I say I don’t think immigration should be this hard — you know I mean it. I felt completely alone in the process, fed up, and very ready to flip the process on its head. By October 2023, I decided to incorporate Tukki with Saveliy Vasilev and supported by José De Wit , our legal advisor who leads a team of lawyers and paralegals. We married the technological expertise with legal structure to make a solution that people really need. Tukki today Q: How does Tukki fit into your own life plans and aspirations? A: Bare minimum, I want to spend my life doing something that matters. It could be the most successful piece of technology, but whatever happens, I plan to enjoy this journey. And you know what, the feeling every time we achieve the “approved” notification for an applicant, and they leave the consulate in the green, that feeling is like no other.

WE CAN HELP Need more clarity? Find quick answers to frequent visa questions from our legal experts Can I work while waiting for my green card approval? Yes, if you apply for and receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) as part of your Adjustment of Status. Without an EAD, you cannot work until your green card is approved, unless you already hold a valid work visa. Is health insurance in the US necessary to apply for a visa? Health insurance isn’t necessary in order to obtain a visa in the US. However, it is recommended you plan for this expense for as soon as you arrive in the US. Can I switch employers while on an O-1 visa? Yes. You can change employers, but in most cases the new employer must file a new petition before you can begin working with them. The only exception is for O-1B visas filed through a U.S. agent—in those cases, you may switch or add employers without needing to file a new petition. Can dependents of O-1 or H-1B visa holders attend public school in the U.S.? Yes. Children with O-3 or H-4 visas may attend public schools without additional authorization. How many pages should a petition have? A US visa application should be as few pages long as possible to thoroughly document your case. Avoid bulking up your case with evidence that repeats itself or adds minimal value—your lawyer can guide you in this sense. The forms alone take up 15-20 pages, and you will attach evidence and cover letters. Some petitions require more evidence than others. Tukki’s lawyers have seen many O-1A and EB-1A petitions that are as long as 400-1,000 pages, but EB-2 NIW applications that only required 200 pages to sufficiently document the case. For an applicant that received an enormous prize, an Oscar or Nobel prize for example, an O-1A application could be even fewer than 400 pages. We’ve also seen applicants sending more than 2,500 pages, but the length of a visa petition varies on a case by case basis.

Computer science, applied to US immigration — Saveliy Vasilev&#x27;s story in Tukki Contributor Nadine Heir Reading time 8 mins read Date published Jul 22, 2024 In entrepreneurship, the way co-founders find each other sets the stage for the venture’s success, not only its inception. Saveliy Vasilev&#x27;s path to founding Tukki is a testament to this. With a background rooted in computer science and academia, Saveliy transitioned to management consulting at McKinsey, seeking real-world business acumen, and it was here that he met Ramiro Roballos , a fellow consultant with a unique background in music. Their shared values and complementary skills forged a strong partnership, laying the foundation for what would become Tukki. This pivotal encounter underscores the importance of finding the right collaborator, as their combined expertise and vision are propelling them to create the premium US immigration experience. Q: What were you doing before Tukki — thinking about starting a business? A: I was thinking about starting a business even while I was doing my undergrad. In fact, even before that: when choosing what to study I thought about doing an undergrad in economics or business administration. But I finally opted for Computer science instead, and for a while I lived a mainly academic life: I had the opportunity to work in a lab, helping in what I could, and began growing closer to the faculty team who’d become my M.Sc. and PhD lecturers later. While I was in my first undergrad year, I attended a lecture given by Julian Mestre about Approximation Algorithms . At that time, I didn’t understand much but found it very interesting. So a few years later, when finishing my undergrad I wrote to Julian, and asked him to be my Ph.D. advisor. It ended up being Julian Mestre (an Argentinean living in Australia), Min Chih Lin (a Taiwanese professor living in Argentina) advising myself (a Russian living in Argentina) — as international as it gets! We made it work and I spent 5 years researching problems and publishing articles on my chosen fascination. Moving the needle: Academia or entrepreneurship? After years in academia, by the time I was doing my PhD the idea of starting a business had cemented in my mind. I felt like I was on an intellectually exciting journey but I wanted to be able to say, “I gave something tangible to these specific people”, and for that something to be more than interesting publications. I recall thinking: the probability of me moving the needle in someone’s life doing science is much lower than doing so through the private enterprise. With that thought in mind towards the end of my doctoral program, I read a ton of books about the economy, history, business people, finance, etc. While that helped me build my own frameworks to think about life in general, the learning was still too conceptual and theoretical. So, equipped with a coordinate system that worked well for me, I decided that I had to get some real-life business skills before considering starting a venture by myself. “What’s next after the dissertation?” I asked myself. Accelerated learning Moving from theory into action, I set out to find the best practical business experience I had within reach. I wrote to different people I knew had business experience to explore what options might be available to me. Among others, I was introduced to a director from Accenture, and while doing my homework before our meeting I got interested in consulting — not tech consulting but rather in management consulting: “at the end the day, these guys help senior folks through their toughest decisions, where else would I learn as fast?” I thought. Q: Where did you decide to boost your business acumen? A: Well, I Googled “what are the top management consulting firms,” and according to the search engine the answer was MBB, which stands for McKinsey, Bain and BCG. So I applied to McKinsey after a contact introduced me to a recruiter of theirs. They made me an offer and the learning journey began. The people, management and communication skills I learned there were invaluable to a nerd like me! During the consulting career one switches projects quite often and the teams one works with change as well. This allows one to develop a taste for management styles and ways of working. While with McKinsey I also met my now-co-founder of Tukki , Ramiro Roballos. He also has a non-traditional background compared to most consultants, with his career as an orchestra director and owner of a small music school. We clicked. We worked side-by-side for a client and we became close friends after many late hours at the clients offices. During our careers the growth we had as people and professionals was unmeasurable. The right person for the right venture Since those early days of our McKinsey careers, Ramiro and I spoke many times about doing something together. We shared key values including integrity, zero dishonesty tolerance, transparency, meritocracy; and that cascaded into our shared views on leadership style, what kind of organization we would like to be part of, and so on. I honestly cannot think of anyone better as a co-founder. And it’s just as well — now we spend more time working on Tukki than with our families. Q: What convinced you to improve the immigration experience? A: As you can imagine we discussed many ideas before landing on immigration. One lesson I learned the hard way, before starting Tukki, is that building a business based on a “nice-to-have” idea is incredibly difficult: if you need to spend a lot of time convincing people to buy, however valuable your service or product is, then you’re facing an uphill climb. Then came Ramiro, sharing his painful experience of obtaining his green card . Added to that, my recollections about my two immigration experiences weren’t particularly fun either. So, as well-trained former consultants, we researched what the current state of affairs was and how to make it at least one order of magnitude better. An industry in dire need of an update The antiquated form in which people apply for visas is not only slow, US immigration processes leverages neither technology nor time-tested operational practices. Ramiro and I knew a thing or two about these topics, so we set out to make a dent in this field. Q: What’s a vision of yours that you’re applying in Tukki? A: I realized that each time I add value to someone’s life my happiness level increases. So doing that with people I enjoy working with and being able to sustain that in the long run is something I want for my life. Since we already had been in the trenches and had a lot of fun, I thought that jumping into some other trenches with Ramiro would be just as great. So we began to work on Tukki and take it as far as we can. At the time we said, if it’s not the right route, we’ll do something else. But the further we get into this venture, the more certain I am that we’re changing the status-quo of how immigrants navigate the visa application — you know, there’s something beautiful when you see that smile on a clients’ face as a life-changing event happens: “It’s approved”, and the journey bringing them there was pleasant. We have a 100% success rate for visa acceptance — the relief and joy that applicants share with us when their visa is approved is incomparable. And no, we haven’t served thousands of clients yet so that 100% might not last forever — but I’ll take pride in that nice round number while I can! Enjoy this? Connect with Saveliy on LinkedIn to see his story continue to unfold! WE CAN HELP Need more clarity? Find quick answers to frequent visa questions from our legal experts Can the employer change the job description or salary after recruitment begins? No. Once recruitment starts, the job requirements and prevailing wage cannot be changed without restarting the entire process from the beginning. What are the total costs of US immigration including legal fees, USCIS fees and any other payments? The total cost for US immigration varies depending on the type of visa and the number of applicants. On average, the all-inclusive cost ranges from $10,000 to $15,000 for a work visa and from $14,000 to $20,000 for a green card. For a family of four, the cost might range from $10,000 to $15,000 for a work visa and from $14,000 to $30,000 for a green card. To know the specific cost of your visa or green card application, consult our visa pricing calculator . How much documentation do I need to file a visa petition for an EB-1A or O-1A visa? In US immigration processes, your claims must be more likely than not to be true. This means if something appears more true than false, USCIS should accept it as true. To meet this standard, the visa petitioner should provide documents that convincingly support the claim’s validity. For instance, to prove you received VC funding, you could provide signed SAFE agreements with a VC, a published article about your funding round, and documentation about the relevance of the VC. Keep in mind that theory and practice do not always perfectly align. It’s crucial you speak to an experienced legal team to avoid spending time and money on documentation that does not support your case. What is PERM? A PERM (Program Electronic Review Management) is a labor certification issued by the U.S. Department of Labor. It does NOT give immigration status. Instead, it confirms that no qualified and willing U.S. worker is available for the job and that the employer will pay at least the prevailing wage. It is the first step toward most EB-2 and EB-3 green cards. Do O-1 visas have a maximum number of years like H-1B? No. O-1 visas can be renewed indefinitely in increments (usually 1–3 years), as long as you continue to meet the criteria.

As Director of Real Estate at Casas KREA , he had previously worked with his company&#x27;s lawyer to navigate the complexities of H-1B and O-1 visas, in addition to assisting with visas for his company’s construction workers. That initial process was anything but smooth. Complex and stressful O-1 visa application process The problems began with poor documentation control. Akrisht had diligently compiled all the necessary documents, categorically organizing them according to the lawyers&#x27; requests. However, “only as the application deadline approached did the lawyers begin communicating, asking for the same documents that had already been submitted,” Akrisht tells us. This led to delays and stress, as the legal team seemed to lose track of the materials Akrisht had already provided. One particularly frustrating experience involved a visa application for a worker that should have been straightforward: it was a TN visa and required only basic documents, such as a resume, a letter of offer, and a brief explanation of the worker&#x27;s skills and the company&#x27;s needs. Despite submitting these documents well in advance, the lawyers informed Akrisht just days before the visa interview that the offer letter format was incorrect , requiring a last-minute revision. The repeated miscommunications, last-minute changes, and general lack of organization from the legal team left Akrisht overwhelmed and frustrated—as it would any visa applicant. “Just applying for that was very, very stressful. I was spending more time applying for people&#x27;s visas than I was working on my own job, ” says Akrisht. When the time came to apply for his own O-1 visa application, the experience managing others’ visas made him question whether this legal team was the right fit. The O-1 visas require even more rigorous documentation and proof of qualifications, and need to be entrusted to true pros. Going it alone: Worth the effort? Akrisht had also tried to manage some visa applications independently in the past, particularly with his F1 student visa. For example, one critical payment required for the visa process was mentioned only in a single line on the website. The payment had to be made through a separate website, managed by a different department, and proof of payment needed to be brought to the visa appointment… “Why can&#x27;t they put everything in one place?!” marvels Akrisht. This lack of clarity had led to several of Akrisht’s acquaintances being rejected at their visa appointments, exacerbating the sense that a successful visa process would be impossible alone . “For the F1 visa, there are some forums sharing recommendations of what you can submit and take to interviews, but there’s nothing like that for the O-1,” explains Akrisht. While it might be feasible to handle a student visa on his own, securing an O-1 visa—a much more complex and documentation-heavy process—would require professional help. Accompanied and supported through the O-1 visa application Recognizing the need for a more reliable and supportive legal team, Akrisht was referred to Tukki, including our expert lawyers. From the very beginning, the difference in approach was evident. “I got my O-1 visa approved thanks to the team at Tukki and their lawyers were amazing, a really good process. The team did everything to the best of their ability.” Unlike his previous experiences, Akrisht felt supported throughout the entire application process. The team worked closely with him to gather and organize all the necessary evidence, emphasizing the importance of thorough and accurate documentation. They were proactive in their communication, addressing any potential issues well before they could become problems. This level of attention and professionalism gave Akrisht confidence that his application was in good hands. Even in moments of doubt, Akrisht appreciated the transparency and honesty of the team at Tukki. They made it clear that while they would do everything in their power to present the strongest possible case, the outcome would ultimately depend on the sufficiency of the evidence provided. This straightforward communication helped manage expectations and reduce stress, allowing Akrisht to focus on gathering the best possible documentation for his application. The successful O-1 visa outcome We have a happy ending! Akrisht was approved for his O-1 visa, a significant achievement that he credits to the exceptional support he received from Tukki’s legal team. The difference in his experience with this team compared to his previous attempts was night and day. Where other lawyers had caused stress and confusion, Ramiro&#x27;s team provided clarity, support, and effective guidance. Akrisht’s case highlights the importance of working with a knowledgeable and attentive legal team when navigating the US immigration processes. He learned the hard way that trying to manage such a process alone, or with inadequate support, can lead to unnecessary stress and potential failure. We’re thrilled that with the right team by his side, he was able to secure his visa with the premium experience curated by Tukki. WE CAN HELP Need more clarity? Find quick answers to frequent visa questions from our legal experts How much documentation do I need to file a visa petition for an EB-1A or O-1A visa? In US immigration processes, your claims must be more likely than not to be true. This means if something appears more true than false, USCIS should accept it as true. To meet this standard, the visa petitioner should provide documents that convincingly support the claim’s validity. For instance, to prove you received VC funding, you could provide signed SAFE agreements with a VC, a published article about your funding round, and documentation about the relevance of the VC. Keep in mind that theory and practice do not always perfectly align. It’s crucial you speak to an experienced legal team to avoid spending time and money on documentation that does not support your case. Can my company sponsor me for an O-1A if I hold equity in it? According to recent USCIS policy, yes. In general, the agency requires a legitimate employer-employee relationship, which typically involves the ability to “hire, pay, fire, supervise, or otherwise control the work” of the beneficiary. Since this policy is new and USCIS has provided little guidance, it remains unclear how these requirements will be applied in the O-1 context. Can the spouses of O-1 visa holders work? No. Spouses of O-1 visa holders receive an O-3 visa, which allows them to live in the U.S. but not to work. They can study, get a driver’s license, open a bank account, and travel in and out of the country freely, but employment is not permitted. What are the typical questions in the O-1 consular interview? Questions vary, but the most common is: “Tell me why you are extraordinary?” Be ready with a concise summary of your accomplishments. This is the time to confidently highlight your achievements, not to be modest. You should also be prepared to explain the details of your U.S. job—your duties, employer, compensation, and location. How long does it take to get an O-1 visa approved? With premium processing, most O-1 petitions are decided within 15 business days. Without premium processing, a decision can take several months, depending on USCIS workload. The preparation stage—collecting evidence, drafting recommendation letters, and organizing the petition—typically takes anywhere from 6 weeks to 6 months, depending on the applicant’s profile, the attorney’s approach, and how quickly supporting documents are provided.
