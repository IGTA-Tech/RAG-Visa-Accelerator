**Content Sections:**

### 4.1 The Assessment Tool
- URL: aivisaevaluations.online
- Time: 2 minutes
- Purpose: Evaluate current O-1 criteria strength
- Output: Percentage score + criterion breakdown

### 4.2 Score Interpretation

| Score | Meaning | Route To |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 0-15% | Very early stage | Profile Builder or Filing Accelerator |
| 16-34% | Building momentum | Profile Builder Elite or Filing Accelerator |
| 35-50% | Filing ready (basic) | Ready Filing |
| 51-75% | Strong candidate | Ready Filing (high confidence) |
| 76%+ | Exceptional | Ready Filing (expedite) |

### 4.3 Routing Logic

**Score 0-34%:**
- Need evidence building
- Options: Profile Builder ($800/mo), Elite ($1,400/mo), or Filing Accelerator ($2,000/mo)
- Ask: "Do you want filing included?"
  - Yes → Filing Accelerator
  - No → Profile Builder or Elite based on guidance preference

**Score 35%+:**
- Ready to file now
- Route to Ready Filing ($11K-$15K)
- Ask: "How urgent is your timeline?"
  - Urgent → Premium processing ($15K)
  - Flexible → Regular processing ($11K)

### 4.4 The Consultation Process
1. Assessment completed → Score generated
2. Book strategy call (15-30 minutes)
3. Review score and criteria gaps
4. Discuss timeline and goals
5. Recommend appropriate program
6. Answer questions and objections
7. Enrollment or follow-up

### 4.5 Common Qualification Questions

**"I only have 1 criterion—can I still get O-1?"**
→ Not yet. You need 3. Profile Builder programs help you build the other 2-5.

**"I have publications but they're not in major outlets—does that count?"**
→ Depends on the outlet. We evaluate during assessment. Trade publications can work.

**"I don't have any awards. Is that a problem?"**
→ No. Awards are just 1 of 8 criteria. We can build other areas instead.

**"My salary isn't exceptionally high—does that disqualify me?"**
→ No. High salary is optional (only 1 of 8). Most successful cases don't use this criterion.

**Assessment Questions:**
1. What score means someone is "ready to file"?
2. If someone scores 25%, what programs should you recommend?
3. How long does the assessment take?
4. What's the purpose of the strategy call?

### Understanding Our Core Legal Structure

**Learning Objectives:**
- Explain what an agent-petitioner is
- Articulate the legal basis
- Compare to employer-sponsored O-1
- Handle objections about legitimacy

**Content Sections:**

### 5.1 What is an Agent-Petitioner?
- The organization that files Form I-129 with USCIS
- Represents the visa holder's career/work arrangements
- Creates and manages the work itinerary
- NOT the employer—the career manager

### 5.2 Legal Basis
- 8 CFR 214.2(o) explicitly permits agent-based petitions
- Used for decades in entertainment industry
- Increasingly common in technology sector
- USCIS recognizes and approves regularly

### 5.3 How It Works
1. IGTA files petition as your agent
2. We create your work itinerary
3. You work for any employer on itinerary
4. Add new employers without refiling
5. Renewal every 3 years through us

### 5.4 Agent-Based vs. Employer-Sponsored

| Factor | Employer-Sponsored | Agent-Based (IGTA) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Tied to one employer | Yes | No |
| Work for multiple companies | No | Yes |
| Start a business | No | Yes |
| Freelance/consult | No | Yes |

- We provide project assignments
- Can include multiple employers
- Can include your own business
- Updated as opportunities change

### 5.6 Common Objections & Responses

**"Is this legal?"**
→ "Absolutely. Agent-based petitions are explicitly authorized under 8 CFR 214.2(o). It's been used in entertainment for decades and is now standard in tech."

**"My employer says I need them to sponsor me."**
→ "That's one option. But agent-based gives you more flexibility. You can still work for that employer—just not be tied only to them."

**"Will USCIS question this?"**
→ "We file agent-based petitions regularly. USCIS is familiar with this structure."

**"How do you qualify as an agent?"**
→ "IGTA is a licensed talent agency authorized to represent professionals. We meet all USCIS requirements for agent-petitioners."

**Assessment Questions:**
1. What is the legal regulation that permits agent-based O-1 petitions?
2. Name 3 things you can do with agent-based O-1 that you can't with employer-sponsored.
3. What is an itinerary of work and why is it required?
4. How do you respond when someone asks "Is this legal?"

## MODULE 9: OBJECTION HANDLING & SALES CONVERSATIONS
### Addressing Concerns and Closing Enrollments

**Learning Objectives:**
- Handle common objections effectively
- Know when to push and when to pause
- Differentiate between objection types
- Close with confidence

**Content Sections:**

### 9.1 Price Objections

**"It's too expensive."**
→ "I understand. Let's look at the value: You're investing $11K-$24K for a visa that enables $275K+ average salaries. That's 10-25x return in year one. Plus, no lottery, multiple employers, entrepreneurship rights. What's the cost of NOT having this flexibility?"

**"I can't afford monthly payments."**
→ "We have options. Profile Builder is $800/month—less than many coding bootcamps. And some clients pay while working, treating it as a career investment. What monthly amount would work for your budget?"

**"Why is it more expensive than just hiring a lawyer?"**
→ "Lawyers file paperwork. We build the evidence you need AND file. Most lawyers need you to already have strong credentials. We create them. Plus, you get agent-petitioner flexibility no lawyer provides."

### 9.2 Legitimacy Objections

**"Is this really legal?"**
→ "Absolutely. Agent-based petitions are explicitly authorized under federal regulation 8 CFR 214.2(o). This structure has been used in entertainment for decades. We file regularly with 500+ successful cases. USCIS knows exactly what this is."

**"I've never heard of this."**
→ "Most people only know H-1B because that's what employers sponsor. But O-1 has been around since 1990. Agent-based structure is just less marketed because it doesn't require employer involvement. It's actually more common than you'd think."

**"My employer/attorney says I need traditional sponsorship."**
→ "That's their perspective. They benefit from you being tied to them. Agent-based gives YOU control. You can still work for that employer—just not exclusively. Want to see some success stories of people who made this switch?"

### 9.3 Qualification Objections

**"I don't think I'm extraordinary enough."**
→ "Most people feel that way—it's imposter syndrome. 'Extraordinary ability' doesn't mean Nobel Prize. It means documented achievement above average. If you've published, won anything, been featured anywhere, or led projects at good companies, you probably have more evidence than you realize."

**"I don't have any awards."**
→ "Awards are just 1 of 8 criteria. Most successful O-1 cases don't rely heavily on awards. Publications, media, projects, and judge roles are often easier to build."

**"I'm too early in my career."**
→ "2-5 years of experience is actually our sweet spot. You have enough achievements to build on, but enough time for it to matter. Early career is perfect for Profile Builder—you'll build evidence while you grow."

### 9.4 Timing Objections

**"I want to wait until I have a job offer."**
→ "Here's the catch-22: Companies want to know you have work authorization before offering jobs. With agent-based O-1, you don't need a job offer to file. You can show employers you're already approved or in process. That's actually MORE attractive to them."

**"My OPT doesn't expire for 18 months."**
→ "Perfect timing. That gives you runway to build evidence properly. If you wait until 6 months before expiration, you're rushing. Starting now means you file with strong evidence and still have OPT as backup."

**"I want to try H-1B lottery first."**
→ "I understand. But consider: H-1B is 14% odds, October-only start, ties you to one employer, $100K minimum salary. If you build O-1 evidence now and don't get H-1B, you can file O-1 immediately. If you DO get H-1B, you'll have built skills and credentials anyway. There's no downside to starting."

### 9.5 Trust Objections

**"How do I know you'll actually help me get approved?"**
→ "Great question. We only file when evidence is strong. We include two filings in the Accelerator precisely because we're committed to your approval. And we have 500+ success stories."

**"I want to talk to someone who's done this."**
→ "Absolutely. We can connect you with alumni who've been through the program. We also have success stories on our website. Want me to share some relevant to your situation?"

### 9.6 Closing Techniques

**The Summary Close:**
"So to recap: You're looking to [goal], you have [timeframe], and [program] fits because [reasons]. The investment is [price]. What questions do you have before we get you enrolled?"

**The Alternative Close:**
"Based on your situation, either Profile Builder Elite or Filing Accelerator would work. Elite is $1,400/month if you want to arrange filing separately later. Accelerator is $2,000/month with filing included. Which makes more sense for your goals?"

**The Urgency Close (when appropriate):**
"Your OPT expires in [X months]. To have O-1 approved by then, we need to start evidence building now. Every month we delay is one less month of evidence. Can we get you enrolled this week?"

**Assessment Questions:**
1. How do you respond to "I can't afford it"?
2. What's the catch-22 with waiting for a job offer?
3. How do you address legitimacy concerns about agent-based petitions?
4. What's your response to "I'm not extraordinary enough"?

2. What's the difference between our role and an attorney's role?
3. What are two situations where you should decline a client?
