All right, so I'll just increase this. Okay, so what we're doing here is we're doing our house training just to show where stuff is as it stands and how to navigate the site. As you know, you have an email address, which is Brett. And then when you go here to compose an email, if you do a dropdown, you'll see that you have different brands here. So it can be Innovative Global Talent Agency. Oh, I guess you need a... So this one doesn't have a signature block. I can make a signature on top with the gear. The gear button has it on the, go down to the gear. Yeah, I know how to do it. I just like, you were supposed to have it already. So now I'm just going to go. Do you want me to have the same signature as you for alignment? Nah, like it's, it's okay because mine has like HTMLT. I'm probably getting rid of mine's either. Do you have a banner for your company that I can use to make it look really professional for us? All right. I mean, like, you know, whatever you want to do, it's a, What's my title? Can I be, I don't need to be EVP of BizDev, but can I be director of business development or head of BD? What do you prefer? What looks, what do you recommend or what do you like or you're comfortable with? All right. I mean, on here it always says Senior VP, Global Business Development. Perfect. Yeah, yeah. That's even more money. And I don't mind if it's just – Have you been able to log into this? You haven't been able to log into this yet, have you? No, listen, I haven't yet because I've been – obviously, I'm not saying I didn't do it because I didn't get to it. I just – with my friend and everything, I'm just kind of – but I will – you sent me an email about that, right, because I saw it. Yeah, no problem. I'll go in there. I just got to activate the Gmail and log in. Once I log in, I'll make a signature and I'll make my signature uniform, but it'll have the different business email in each one. They'll have the connect button. And then, and when I start Monday, do you have seats for LinkedIn or do you have to go in and start figuring out how to do that? All right. So like right now we're not suffering for leads. It's just trying to explain is like, we just put a duck soup thing. So we don't need, we don't, The seat thing doesn't help. Like we don't have that problem to solve. I'm going to go through the leads and monetize opposed to searching. So I can leave it as is so I can access you. Yeah. Like, you know, we don't have a current issue with, um, yeah, getting to people. Now, what would be helpful is if we add one of our duck soup licenses to your account. And Ryan does that. So that way, the way that it does the automated messages for mine, it does it for yours with your, your link. So, you know how this guy was like, oh, I thought I booked with shared. This one will be like a book from yours in the first place. All right. So we'll make templates of the first outreach for me. I'll clear it with you. You tell me what you want it to say. I'll make a second one as a follow-up that's a little more personal. And then I'll use my templates with Brisking, which is free, like I told you. It'll pop up in my Gmail with an icon. And I can use those. And then I can share those templates with you. So if you actually get somebody on the phone that you want to follow up yourself with an interview or whatever, you could just use the same template as me and just take it under your personal ones. And your little icon for Berskine will pop up in your Gmail as well. And I can help you with that so you can put it in yours. All right. Sounds good. All right. The other thing is you mentioned having a tab where. there are the different brands and just people here that are like leads to follow up on. That's just like for yours. So we made it as simple as possible. Before I get into that, I'll show you where it comes from. This comes from our big lead sheet, which is here. There's like thousands of contacts in here. And so what happens is as I or Jonalyn sees somebody that might be a good candidate for a particular point, we just go like this. You just press this button and then it will push that lead to your personal sheet. And then that sheet that you have, you can do whatever you want. So if you're talking to somebody and you know that they're not about the clothes or anything and it's just not going to work out, you could just delete that from your sheet and then that's fine. So you see how this has all this type of info in here? Yours is much streamlined from that. You don't have all that other stuff in here. So the main one that you're worried about is the AI talent leads. Those are the ones that we're looking for. for to, uh, that's responded on LinkedIn. Those are the initial meetings I'm going to have and take them to qualification, pass them to you for the start. Well, these are people that have responded on LinkedIn and like, so some of them might've had meetings scheduled. Some of them might've not, but like their leads had at least expressed interest. So that's why they're worth like following up. And some of them, we have their emails and I think Jonalyn is getting the rest and some we have phone numbers. So we did send them the message originally to, to But then it's like, OK, and like while it's populating itself, you could like, you know, email them. So like, hey, just checking in to see if you're interested, you know, stuff like that. Then if they aren't, you just take them off the list and like this list will keep growing. Like we don't have a problem right now with getting more people in it. The only thing that we need is for Ryan to get with you about setting up the campaign. And like you said, you'll come with your spiel for it. And then maybe Ryan has something that he already had. Combine those, and then it just automatically contacts people through his belay and search. That makes sense. Is Ryan in Indiana? Is he in Indiana? Say that again? Is Ryan in Indiana? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so this sheet for me, this is where you said like they're either falling through the cracks where they're set up with you and I'm going to take over or they interest. So I'm going to reach out to them and say, I've just come aboard, you know, XYZ and I'm going to be taking over the business development for the first initial screening. Here's my email. I want to go over all the information you need and make sure you're comfortable before I, you know, segue you over to Sherrod for initial conversation. Whatever the... I mean... Like, honestly, I mean, that's fine. Well, listen, I'm just freelancing what I'm saying. Either way, these people want information, but they're going to meet me first, and I'll go over the information. Whatever questions they have, I will share with you. Go over the pricing or give them the sheet. Like, I'm going to make you something that you don't have to even go to me. Like, you can just ask, and they'll tell you, like, literally everything that you need. Like, what's the pricing? You'll have all of that, the links, everything. And once they're cleared, I know they're a good qualified lead. It goes to you where, you know, they're in the arena. They may not do it, but honestly, honestly, it's not realistic. They might have to go to Ankit or something like that, because like now, like I'm really trying to be like realistic, like I'm not. It's not all that realistic that I'll meet with individuals. All right, well, listen, if I can qualify them to the point of I got a good idea how qualified they are, you tell me where to send them, and then however they close, whatever the process is, I'm just the front-line bouncer, so you just tell me what to do, when to do it. Now, here's the other thing. Remember I said we have a whole API thing that goes and tells them. The only thing that we need to know is they have the money and they want to do it. We already know if they're qualified. Okay, so let me give you a few tools. So one, like, here's like, uh, your link here that I'll send to you. Um, in an email that has like, so your, to your calendar, I have sent an email to somebody named coach. You'll see an email code chef, uh, to you somewhere. Um, and if not, I'll send it again, but he'll get it. So that's on your schedule. He could tell him, you tell him like, Hey, I only went two hours on Wednesday or something like that. And then this, this link will only go to that. All right. Now these people that we're finding. For this, it's not a matter of like seeing if they're qualified or not, because we have an internal tool that already does that. I'm going to show you like where it's based off. So this AI visa evaluation thing is our own is our own thing. So it's like, huh? You built that? Yeah, we built this. Nice. So I put that here. Now, the other thing is when we're bringing these in and under the full sheet, which I'll give you access to for the my visa job candidates is like it automatically scores them based on their background overnight. Right. Sorry. Was that the thirty five thirty five number? Was that that you're talking about before? Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah. So in my visa job candidate sheets, we got two tabs where there's like people. And so I'm going to give you the link to this too, but this is not something you have to look at every day because it's just a lot to look at. But if you really just had to know what somebody's score is right away, you could physically run them through that tool that I just told you, and it'll give you the score. Or you can just go here because they're probably already here. Does it pre-populate their score in there automatically or no? It does. Okay. I'm going to try to find out what... with actual ones in. Now, are we going to like when you populate the numbers, we can obviously toggle it with the highest numbers downward. You want me to tackle the highest numbers downward to get that flow of money coming in quicker or a better chance? Well, I mean, it's a combination of being eligible and a combination of having the money as you look through it. So like you see here that you have all these candidate scores. So these. Yeah, so like, you know, we have people Like probably over thirty five. That's looking. Oh, you're right. A fifty one could have no money and a twenty six could have cash. That's right. Yeah. It doesn't matter. I got to send a note because this is not still having some issues. So I think the best thing would be once we get the templates done, maybe we walk one candidate through the process of you doing it, maybe saying, hey, let's send something out to them so I can see it in process, one person, and I can replicate it. All right, no problem. I'm kind of a visual and audit, whatever, or it's called visual and auditory. And you, dude, you fly. You're flying, dude. Like I'm trying to grab your coattails and I'm missing it. I'm trying. I mean, some is just like, you know, it's like, oh, probably be like, hey, how do I qualify? I'm like, don't worry about it. We already did it. And then it's just like, you know, doing the search for us. Like, don't worry about the search. The search is already happening. That's not even the problem. As you see, we have we already found them. So in one sentence, what exactly? Because I was to do what I think I was doing. And it's fine. We can always be fluid. You can switch it up, whatever. I don't care. I'm good on the fly. if i'm going to be going through i thought i was going through people that wanted information when i get to them it's literally you send them obviously information with my link in there hold on hold on hold on hold on because like right now i'm just doing the like i'm breaking this up in a segment so this one's just doing the the uh showing you where stuff is but i'll get into that next with the actual stuff like let me let me uh Let me close this one out, and then I'll start another session that'll be called something else. What would you like the next session to be about? What do you specifically want to cover next? So I'll call it that, and then it'll be a module specifically for that. I'm trying to just digest. I guess I'm looking for you to feed me All right. What I'm needing to do, because like I said, let me just give you my my interpretation. You can correct it and rewire me. My interpretation was you have tons of leads, whether they're all populated or not. I am basically taking the ones that are missed and taking the ones that are asking for information that are not in touch or anything. Instead of you having to schedule them on your calendar, I'm going to reach out to them and say, hey, I know you're interested in our services. Here's my link. Set up a time with me and I'll go over what your concerns are and questions. But in the meantime, take a look at our services. Take a look at the pricing as well. And let's meet at a time that's good for you. Then I meet them. They're already qualified from the questions, whatever. Then I'm going to pass them along into process. And then you guys try to close them. Is that in a nutshell what I'm doing? And if it's not, clarify it. All right. Like I said, I would like to cover that in the next one because this one. You just run. You just go. All right. So I'll just close this one out. And then I'll send it when you log into your email. You'll see your Calendly link. You'll see the online tool for evaluations. Let me get you your personal business development sheet, which is this right here. I'll call it bread sheet. And like this one, you can do whatever you want. Like as we just click a button and it puts hot stuff there per brand. And then you just do what you want with this. This is like the long form. All right. So I'm going to send that to you. And I'm going to just call this one housekeeping. Oh, yeah. OK, there we go. Housekeeping. All right. Then we'll get into what you know. I know that you're going to get into the bare bones of what the product is and what's going on. All right. So let me close this one out. And I won't put an outro on it. And then give me a second, it's gonna kick us out, then we can start over.
