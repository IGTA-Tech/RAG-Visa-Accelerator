## SAMPLE PITCH (SHORT)

**Subject:** From Canelo Alvarez to Silicon Valley: Immigration Lawyer Solves Tech's Visa Crisis

Hi [Name],

While 670,000 H-1B applicants were rejected in 2024's lottery, immigration litigator Sherrod D. Seward found a better way.

After securing O-1 visas for world boxing champions Canelo Alvarez and Tyson Fury (combined 20M+ followers), Seward is now applying the same agent-based petition strategy to tech workers - offering multiple employers and business ownership that H-1B can never provide.

The legal basis? 8 CFR 214.2(o) - used in entertainment for decades, now transforming how tech talent enters the US.

## SAMPLE PITCH (DETAILED)

**Subject:** STORY PITCH: The Immigration Litigator Who Went from Boxing Champions to Silicon Valley

Dear [Editor Name],

**THE HOOK:**
When Sherrod D. Seward secured O-1 visas for Canelo Alvarez (16.8M Instagram followers) and Tyson Fury, he wasn't just helping boxing champions work in America. He was perfecting a legal strategy that would later help solve tech's biggest talent crisis.

**THE PROBLEM:**
In 2024, 670,000 H-1B visa applicants were rejected. That's an 85% rejection rate - determined by lottery, not merit. MIT PhDs and decade-veteran engineers rejected alongside entry-level applicants. The $100K salary minimum has locked out early-career professionals entirely.

**THE SOLUTION:**
Seward discovered that 8 CFR 214.2(o) - the regulation allowing agent-based O-1 petitions, used in entertainment for decades - works just as well for computer scientists and AI engineers.

The results:
- Merit-based approval (vs 14% H-1B lottery selection)
- Work for multiple employers simultaneously
- Start your own business while on visa
- No lottery - 100% merit-based
- Alumni average $275K salary with 3.2 employers

**THE STORY:**
After 500+ successful cases with world-class athletes, Seward pivoted to tech in 2023. He now enrolls 30-50 tech professionals monthly, applying the same proven model that worked for world champions.

"I got P-1 visas on every continent except Antarctica," Seward says. "The legal structure works. Tech just didn't know it existed."

**AVAILABLE FOR:**
- Exclusive interview with Sherrod D. Seward
- Data on H-1B crisis and O-1 alternative
- Success stories from tech professionals
- Expert commentary on immigration policy

Would you be interested in exploring this story?

Best regards,

## TALKING POINTS FOR INTERVIEWS

### On the H-1B System
"The H-1B lottery rejected 670,000 qualified professionals in 2024. A PhD from MIT has the same odds as anyone else - 14%. That's not a merit-based system, it's a random number generator."

### On Agent-Based O-1
"Agent-based petitions have been used in entertainment for decades. We're not inventing anything new - we're applying a proven legal structure to an underserved market. Tech professionals deserve the same career freedom that athletes and entertainers have had for years."

### On the Sports Background
"I started by helping world champions like Canelo Alvarez and Tyson Fury. What I learned is that the agent-based model works - 500+ successful cases. Now I'm bringing that same expertise to tech workers who are trapped by the H-1B lottery."

### On Career Freedom
"H-1B is a golden handcuffs situation. You can't negotiate salary effectively, you can't leave a bad workplace, you can't start a business. Agent-based O-1 changes everything - our alumni work for an average of 3.2 employers and earn $275,000."

### On Timing
"After the 2023-2024 tech layoffs, H-1B holders had 60 days to find a new sponsor or leave the country. Families uprooted, kids pulled from school. With agent-based O-1, a layoff from one employer doesn't affect your visa status at all."
