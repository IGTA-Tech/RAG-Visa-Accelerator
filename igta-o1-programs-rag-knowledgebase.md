## 3.4 What's NOT Included (You Pay Separately)

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| USCIS Filing Fee | $1,055 per filing | Government fee, required |
| Premium Processing | $2,805 per filing | Optional, for 15-day decision |

**Everything else is included.** No hidden attorney fees. No petitioner fees. No profile building charges. No surprise costs.

## 3.5 Why Two Filings Are Included

**First Filing (Months 3-6):**
When evidence reaches filing-ready strength, we file first petition. Many clients approved on this filing.

**Second Filing (Months 9-12):**
If first filing receives RFE or denial, or if you want to file with stronger evidence later, second filing is included. No additional petition fees.

**If Approved on First Filing:**
Second filing can be:
- Saved for O-1 renewal (3 years later)
- Transferred to colleague or referral (with approval)
- Applied toward future immigration planning

**Safety Net:**
Immigration outcomes aren't 100% predictable. Two filings mean room to strengthen, repackage, or reapproach without starting over financially.

**Traditional Employer-Sponsored O-1:**
- Single employer files petition

Yes. The agent-petitioner model is specifically authorized by USCIS regulations. IGTA is a licensed talent agency qualified to serve as an agent-petitioner.

## 6.5 What Is a Work Itinerary?

A work itinerary documents your planned work activities under the O-1 visa. It includes:
- Employers and clients you'll work with
- Projects and engagements

- Nature of work

The itinerary can be updated as your work evolves. IGTA helps create and maintain your itinerary.
