## SECTION 5: WHY AGENT-BASED STRUCTURE

**H2 Heading:**
Why Agent-Based O-1 Beats Employer-Sponsored

**The Problem with Employer-Sponsored O-1:**

Traditional O-1 petitions are filed by a single employer:
- âŒ Tied to that one company
- âŒ Can't switch jobs without refiling
- âŒ No consulting or freelancing
- âŒ Can't start your own business
- âŒ Employer controls your visa

**It's basically H-1B restrictions with O-1 requirements.**

---

**The Agent-Based Advantage:**

IGTA serves as your agent-petitioner:

âœ… **Work for Anyone**  
Multiple employers, clients, or your own company

âœ… **Complete Flexibility**  
Accept or decline opportunities without visa concerns

âœ… **No Refiling to Switch Jobs**  
Work itinerary allows various employers and projects

âœ… **Entrepreneurship Allowed**  
Start businesses while maintaining O-1 status

âœ… **You Control Your Career**  
Agent works for you, not the other way around

**How It's Legal:**

Agent-based O-1 petitions are explicitly permitted under **8 CFR 214.2(o)(2)(iv)(E)**. USCIS has approved agent-based petitions for decades in entertainment, sports, and increasingly in tech/business.

**Our 94% approval rate proves it works.**

## SECTION 7: FAQ

**H2 Heading:**
Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I know if I'm "ready" to file?**

A: You're ready if you already have 3-4 of the 8 O-1 criteria documented:
- Awards or recognition
- Published articles or research
- Media coverage
- Judge/expert role
- High salary
- Elite memberships
- Original contributions
- Critical role documentation

Take our free assessment to get an instant score.

---

**Q: What if I'm not quite ready?**

A: If your assessment shows you need more evidence, we'll recommend our Accelerator Program instead. We only file cases we believe will be approved - we don't take your money for weak petitions.

---

**Q: What's the difference between Regular and Premium processing?**

A: 
- **Regular ($11K):** USCIS processes in 4-6 months
- **Premium ($15K):** USCIS must respond within 15 days (includes $2,805 premium processing fee)

Both include the exact same petition quality and services. Only difference is USCIS processing speed.

---

**Q: Can I really start my own business on O-1?**

A: Yes! With our agent-based structure, you can be the founder and CEO of a US company while on O-1 status. The key is that we remain your agent-petitioner managing your overall career, and your business is part of your work itinerary.

This is impossible with employer-sponsored O-1 or H-1B.

---

**Q: What happens if I get an RFE?**

A: RFE (Request for Evidence) means USCIS wants additional documentation. We handle the response at no extra cost (one RFE response included in both packages). Our 94% approval rate means RFEs are uncommon, but we're prepared if one comes.

---

**Q: What if my O-1 is denied?**

A: Rare with our vetting, but if it happens you have two options:
1. **Repackaging & refiling** for $1,500 + filing fees
2. **Discounted Accelerator access** to build missing evidence, then refile

We don't abandon you.

---

**Q: Do I need a job offer before filing?**

A: No! You need an itinerary of work, which we provide through project assignments and our employer network. You don't need a single employer job offer.

---

**Q: Can I work for any company with agent-based O-1?**

A: Yes, as long as the work fits your approved itinerary. For tech/business professionals, this covers software development, consulting, AI/ML work, technical leadership, speaking, and related activities.

You can switch companies, take on new clients, or start businesses without notifying USCIS.

---

**Q: How is this different from just hiring an immigration lawyer?**

A: Immigration lawyers file paperwork but don't provide:
- Agent-petitioner relationship (you'd still need an employer)
- Work itinerary and project assignments
- Employer network access
- Advocacy and case management
- Business ownership structure
- Refile protection

We're a complete service, not just legal filing.

---

**Q: What's included in the work itinerary?**

A: Your itinerary includes:
- Project assignments from our client network
- Consulting opportunities we arrange
- Speaking engagements or expert roles
- Your own business activities (if applicable)
- Timelines and deliverables

This satisfies USCIS requirements while giving you real work opportunities.

---

**Q: How long does the O-1 visa last?**

A: Your O-1 is valid for 3 years initially. It can be renewed unlimited times in 3-year increments as long as you continue to work in your field of extraordinary ability.

---

**Q: Can I get a Green Card after O-1?**

A: Yes! O-1 is a common pathway to EB-1A Green Card. The evidence you used for O-1 often qualifies for EB-1A. We provide guidance on Green Card pathways as part of your agent relationship.
