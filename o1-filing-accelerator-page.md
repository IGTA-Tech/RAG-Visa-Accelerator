---

## TWO FILINGS EXPLAINED SECTION

### Headline:
Why Two Filings Are Included

### Body:
The O-1 process isn't always linear. Including two filings protects you and maximizes your chances of approval.

**First Filing (Months 3-6):**
When your evidence reaches filing-ready strength, we file your first petition. Many clients are approved on this filing.

**Second Filing (Months 9-12):**
If your first filing receives an RFE or denial, or if you want to file with even stronger evidence later, your second filing is already included. No additional petition fees.

**If Approved on First Filing:**
Congratulations! Your second filing can be:
- Saved for your O-1 renewal (3 years later)
- Transferred to a colleague or referral (with approval)
- Applied toward future immigration planning

**The Safety Net:**
Immigration outcomes aren't 100% predictable. Two filings mean you have room to strengthen, repackage, or reapproach without starting over financially.

---

## PREMIUM PROCESSING SECTION

### Headline:
Add Premium Processing

### Body:
Standard O-1 processing takes 4-6 months after filing. Need faster results?

**Premium Processing Add-On:**
- 15 business day decision guarantee
- $2,805 per filing (USCIS fee, paid directly to government)
- Available for either or both filings

**When to Consider Premium:**
- Work authorization expiring soon
- Job offer with start date deadline
- Time-sensitive business opportunity
- Personal timeline requirements

Premium processing is optional. Your two regular-processing filings are fully included in the program investment.

## FAQ SECTION

### Headline:
Frequently Asked Questions

---

**What makes this different from the Profile Builder programs?**

Profile Builder and Profile Builder Elite focus on evidence building only—you arrange filing separately when ready.

The Filing Accelerator includes everything: full profile building support AND two complete O-1 filings with agent-petitioner service and attorney coordination.

If you want one comprehensive solution rather than assembling services separately, the Filing Accelerator is designed for you.

---

**Do I really get two complete O-1 filings?**

Yes. Both filings include:
- Complete petition preparation
- Agent-petitioner service (IGTA as your official petitioner)
- Attorney coordination and legal review
- Form I-129 and all required documentation
- USCIS submission and tracking
- RFE response handling if needed

You only pay the government filing fees ($1,055 per filing). Everything else is included.

---

**Is the investment truly all-inclusive?**

Yes. The $24,000 program investment (or discounted prepay options) includes everything except USCIS government fees:

**Included:** Profile building, publications, media, projects, community, attorney coordination, petition preparation, agent-petitioner service, two filings, Deal Memo Portal, employer networking, success advisor, and all program support.

**Not included:** USCIS filing fees ($1,055/filing) and optional premium processing ($2,805/filing).

No hidden attorney fees. No separate petitioner charges. No surprise costs.

---

**What if I'm approved on the first filing?**

Congratulations! You continue in the program building evidence, connections, and career opportunities. Your second filing can be:
- Saved for your O-1 renewal (required every 3 years)
- Transferred to a qualifying colleague or referral
- Applied toward EB-1A green card planning (discuss with attorney)

---

**What if I'm not approved after both filings?**

Our 94% approval rate means this is rare, but we have you covered. If both filings face issues, you can continue in the program at 50% discount ($1,000/month) until approved. We work with you until you succeed.

---

**How early can I file?**

Some candidates with existing strong credentials can file as early as month 3. Most clients file between months 4-6 when evidence is optimally developed.

During your strategy call, we assess your current credentials and determine the earliest realistic filing timeline for your situation.

---

**How is IGTA able to serve as my petitioner?**

IGTA is a licensed talent agency authorized to serve as an agent-petitioner for O-1 visas. This "agent model" is specifically recognized by USCIS and offers significant advantages:

- Work for multiple employers simultaneously
- Freelance, consult, or take contract work
- Start your own business or side projects
- Change clients or employers without refiling
- Maximum career flexibility under one visa

---

**Can I work for any employer with this visa?**

Yes. The agent-petitioner model provides maximum flexibility. Unlike employer-sponsored visas, you're not tied to a single company. You can:

- Work for multiple employers at once
- Take on new clients and projects
- Freelance or consult
- Pursue entrepreneurial ventures
- Change work arrangements without immigration consequences

All work is documented through your itinerary, coordinated through our Deal Memo Portal.

---

**What employers do you connect me with?**

Our network includes Fortune 500 companies, funded startups, consulting firms, and specialized employers across technology, finance, sports, and entertainment.

Past placements and connections include Goldman Sachs, ESPN, Insight Global, Showtime, NASCAR teams, and numerous technology companies.

We introduce you to opportunities and facilitate connections—hiring decisions remain with employers.

---

**What's the O-1 Deal Memo Portal?**

Our proprietary platform connecting O-1 candidates with employers and work opportunities. Includes:
- Employer listings seeking O-1 talent
- Deal memo templates and agreements
- Work arrangement documentation
- Opportunity tracking and management

Filing Accelerator members get free unlimited access (normally requires separate subscription).

---

**Can I do this while on F-1 or OPT?**

Absolutely. Many participants are F-1 students or OPT holders. Program activities are designed to be compatible with maintaining student status.

Your O-1 filing creates a pathway to work authorization that doesn't depend on employer sponsorship or the H-1B lottery.

---

**What if I'm on H-1B now?**

H-1B holders can participate fully. Many use this program to build an alternative to H-1B limitations:
- No lottery or cap
- No single-employer dependency
- More flexibility to change jobs, freelance, or start businesses
- Your current H-1B status remains unaffected while you build your O-1 profile

---

**How long until I get O-1 approval?**

Timeline varies based on your starting point and processing choice:

**With Regular Processing:**
- Earliest filing: Month 3 (strong existing credentials)
- Typical filing: Month 4-6
- USCIS decision: 4-6 months after filing
- Total timeline: 7-12 months from enrollment

**With Premium Processing:**
- Same filing timeline
- USCIS decision: 15 business days after filing
- Total timeline: 4-9 months from enrollment

---

**What's the difference between regular and premium processing?**

**Regular processing:** USCIS decides within 4-6 months. Included in your program.

**Premium processing:** USCIS guarantees decision within 15 business days. Additional $2,805 government fee per filing.

Both filings in your program use regular processing by default. Premium is available as an add-on for either or both filings.

---

**Can I pause the program?**

Yes. One 60-day pause is allowed after completing the first 3 months, for documented emergencies or significant life circumstances. Contact your success advisor to discuss.

---

**Do you guarantee O-1 approval?**

No one can legally guarantee USCIS approval—be cautious of anyone who claims otherwise.

What we provide:
- Systematic approach with 94% historical approval rate
- Two complete filing attempts included
- Continued support at discounted rate if both filings face issues
- We work with you until you succeed

Our process is designed to maximize your probability of approval.

---

**What industries do you work with?**

Primarily technology, AI/ML, data science, software engineering, product management, and related technical and business fields.

Our affiliated brands (Sherrod Sports Visas, Innovative Global Talent Agency) handle sports and entertainment visas with the same infrastructure.

---

**Can international professionals outside the US join?**

Yes. Profile building and evidence development can be completed from anywhere in the world. When approved, you'll complete consular processing to enter the US with your O-1 visa.

---

**What happens if I leave the program early?**

Everything created under your name—articles, publications, project work, media coverage—belongs to you permanently.

However, filing services are only available to active program participants. If you leave before filing, you can use your evidence with another provider, or re-enroll later to access filing services.

---

**How do I know when I'm ready to file?**

Your monthly O-1 readiness evaluations assess your evidence strength across all criteria. We track:
- Number of criteria with documented evidence
- Quality and strength of evidence per criterion
- Recommendation letters secured
- Overall petition readiness

We file when the evidence supports approval—not before. Your success advisor guides the timing decision.
