## THE CHALLENGE SECTION

### Headline:
Most Tech Professionals Aren't O-1 Ready—Yet

### Body:
You have the skills. You have the experience. But USCIS requires documented proof of extraordinary ability across specific criteria.

Without strategic evidence building, even exceptional professionals face unnecessary delays and denials.

**Common gaps we solve:**
- No major publications or media coverage
- Limited awards or formal recognition
- Few documented contributions to your field
- No judge or expert roles on record
- Missing recommendation letters from industry leaders

The good news? These gaps can be systematically closed with the right strategy and support.

---

## PROGRAM OVERVIEW SECTION

### Headline:
Two Paths to O-1 Qualification

### Intro:
Choose the level of support that matches your timeline, budget, and goals. Both programs build the evidence you need—the difference is how much hands-on guidance you receive along the way.

**Note:** These programs focus on building your profile. Filing services are available separately, or you can choose our Filing Accelerator program that includes both profile building AND complete O-1 filing.

## FAQ SECTION

### Headline:
Frequently Asked Questions

---

**What's the difference between Profile Builder and Profile Builder Elite?**

Profile Builder provides structured frameworks, resources, and group support for self-directed evidence building. You get everything you need to build your profile systematically, but you drive the process.

Profile Builder Elite adds personalized guidance: a dedicated success advisor, 1:1 strategy sessions, attorney access, priority project placement, Deal Memo Portal access, and monthly readiness evaluations. You get hands-on support at every step.

Both programs build the same evidence—Elite accelerates the process with expert guidance and better opportunities.

---

**Can I do this while working full-time?**

Yes. Most participants maintain full-time employment or studies while in the program. The time commitment is 8-12 hours per week, and scheduling is flexible around your primary responsibilities.

---

**Can I do this while on F-1 or OPT?**

Absolutely. Many of our participants are F-1 students or OPT holders. The program activities (writing articles, participating in communities, building projects) are consistent with maintaining your student status. We can discuss your specific situation during your strategy call.

---

**What if I'm on H-1B?**

H-1B holders can participate fully in profile building activities. Many of our participants are building O-1 profiles as a backup or alternative to H-1B limitations. Your current employment remains unaffected.

---

**Does this include O-1 filing?**

No. These programs focus on building your evidence and credentials. When you're ready to file, you can:
1. Upgrade to our O-1 Filing Accelerator (graduates receive $2,000 off)
2. Work with the immigration attorney of your choice
3. Use our petitioner service with your own attorney

If you want profile building AND filing included from the start, the O-1 Filing Accelerator program is designed for you.

---

**How long until I'm ready to file?**

Most participants reach filing-ready status within 6-12 months, depending on their starting point and engagement level. Some build strong profiles faster; others benefit from additional time to strengthen their evidence.

Monthly readiness evaluations (Elite tier) or self-assessments (Profile Builder tier) track your progress toward filing qualification.

---

**What if I want to add filing later?**

Profile Builder graduates who want IGTA to file their O-1 petition receive $2,000 off our filing services. You can also upgrade to the full Filing Accelerator program mid-journey if your goals change.

---

**Can I switch from Profile Builder to Elite?**

Yes. If you start with Profile Builder and decide you want more hands-on support, you can upgrade to Elite. We'll credit your payments toward the new tier and transition you seamlessly.

---

**Can I upgrade to the Filing Accelerator mid-program?**

Yes. If you decide you want filing services included, you can upgrade to the Filing Accelerator at any time. We'll credit your existing payments and adjust your program accordingly.

---

**What industries do you work with?**

Our programs serve professionals across technology, AI/ML, data science, software engineering, product management, and related fields. We also work with professionals in sports, entertainment, and creative industries through our affiliated brands.

---

**Can international professionals outside the US join?**

Yes. A significant portion of our participants are based outside the United States. Profile building activities can be completed from anywhere, and we'll prepare you for filing when you're ready to pursue US employment.

---

**What's the O-1 Deal Memo Portal?**

The Deal Memo Portal is our proprietary platform connecting O-1 candidates with employers and opportunities. It includes work arrangements, deal memo templates, and employer introductions. Elite tier members get free access (normally requires separate subscription).

---

**What happens if I need to pause the program?**

Life happens. Profile Builder Elite participants may request one 60-day pause after completing the first 3 months. Profile Builder participants can pause at the end of any quarterly period. Contact your program advisor to discuss options.

---

**Do you guarantee O-1 approval?**

No one can legally guarantee USCIS approval—be wary of anyone who claims otherwise. What we provide is a systematic approach to building the strongest possible evidence for your O-1 petition. Our filing programs maintain a 94% approval rate because we only proceed to filing when the evidence is strong.

---

**What happens to my work if I leave the program?**

Everything created under your name—articles, publications, project documentation—belongs to you permanently. If you leave the program, you keep all your evidence and can continue your O-1 journey independently or with another provider.

---

**How many people are in each cohort?**

We accept approximately 30-40 new participants per month to maintain quality and individual attention. Profile Builder Elite has smaller cohort sizes for more personalized support. The overall community includes 500+ professionals at various stages.

---

**What if I realize I need more support than Profile Builder offers?**

You can upgrade to Profile Builder Elite at any time. We'll credit your existing payments and transition you to the higher tier with full access to Elite benefits.
