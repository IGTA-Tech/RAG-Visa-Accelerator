we solve problems for the best athletes coaches and organizations in the world hello how's it going this is attorney sherrod seward and right now we're getting into the biz development introduction for shared sports visas uh and I'll share my screen so we can go get started and show a few things of basics of how things work we have a couple of brands that we need business development for but our flagship is shared sports visas where we've done a lot of visas for athletes from around the world and we're really proud of the work that we did here um but we get a lot of organic traffic that comes through this uh website and we kind of position it as a information hub but of course people want to get visas for us as well looks like something's like missing from the site one visa guy okay that's fine this actually looks pretty good so the other thing that we have too is a knowledge hub um so if people have like questions they just want to know about templates and stuff like that we have them go to this knowledge hub and they can sign in and that's a way that they can interact with us um through here which uh which we like a lot and it works out pretty well for us oh looks like our widget is deactivated So I probably need to make a note to do that. So I'm going to pause it while I make a note for myself. Okay, we're back. This is something where we do have assigned where you can log in and pay a monthly fee, but usually we just give it away free for people that are in our pipeline just as an extra feature of doing business with us and considering us. So the most important part of the lead process is this spreadsheet, the Innovative Global Holdings lead sheet. Here you'll see that there's various brands and things, but right now we're only worried about this one, which is the SSV tab. And it starts from the oldest lead, oldest leads going all the way down to the most recent when you go scroll down. And generally, we're more concerned, of course, with the most recent leads to see if we could close them. This one is just, I think this is somebody just trying out to see how things work here, how our lead generation works. But generally, what should happen is when people fill out information, our admin Jonalyn comes and puts them into this spreadsheet, and a lot of times they'll have notes here that says what they're about, and if they had an intake link, like an intake sheet, it would be right there. Lately, it looks like we do not have a lot of intake forms because they should be, you know, it says it's requested. But this is generally how we see what things are going on. And then as you talk to clients to get them to close, there's a couple of tools to use. One for getting them to pay. We have a tool to where you just go to sharesportsvisa.com backslash, they're paying eight thousand. You just put eight thousand here and then you can send them that link and your correspondence. So I'll just do it right now. Right. So you see, it's like the eight thousand. Now, typically we were using something called sign now for engagement letters. So if somebody was doing an eight thousand dollar piece of business, you go share sports visa dot com backslash engagement. Six thousand or five thousand. And it would work out right now. We've had an issue with the program that does that, which is called sign now. And it doesn't work, so we're doing this manually. And how that will work is you can just ask Ankit to send you a PDF version of the, I'm going to contact the sender just to see if that does anything. See if we get it. But in the meantime, just ask Ankit for an engagement letter, and then he'll be able to, get you one and then you can just have them sign it and get back to us we're going to switch to panda docs for this uh in the future I have a conversation with them on friday um and hopefully we'll get that going sooner than later with the new documents by monday but for now when they're paying remember you can just go share sportsvisas.com backslash or you know to get somebody to pay And then for the engagement letterhead and contact and kit, then he'll get you together for that. All right, so the next thing is about pricing and I'll put this down. I think on our website we do have pricing available. Or maybe we took it off. Yeah, we might have taken it off. Let's see. In general, the usual prices at P-one visas are six thousand, O-one visas are eight thousand, and EB-one A are eight thousand, our service fees. We do have it to where they can kind of like split it up. So if you do go to like pricing, you can have them you can send them this link and then they can go and it breaks down the fees and everything that's associated with it. Another thing is if one if somebody wants to know about the processing fees and stuff like that, you can go P one six thousand. And then I'll have a video that explains the pricing, the service fees. So you can be like, hey, if you're doing regular processing, it'll be this price. If you're doing premium processing, it'll be this price, and things of that nature. And then they can also look at petitioner services. So for petitioner services, this is when we act as the agent for them, and we charge two thousand for that. There's two services we use for that. One is Adventist Visa Agents right here. And then we also have Innovative Global Talent Agency. And we kind of pick and choose, but either way, the cost of doing this is two thousand. So if somebody needs a petitioner service, it'll be two thousand. And then remember, if somebody wants to know about the fees or if you're talking to somebody, want to let them know about the filing fees, you can always go to here. So use P one six thousand for P ones go eight oh one eight thousand. for the o ones and you can send them this link too so they can see the video for themselves and then you could also do eb one a eight thousand right for that um I'm trying to think is there anything else but that's the basics of like what we're going to do And then I'll also give you access to chat GPT so that you can use that to answer questions as well when you're going. And I'll kind of go through like the notes. We'd like to figure out a way to get more intake questions here so we know more context of like who's going here, like who's actually contacting us. But since we don't have a lot of those, usually what we want to know is here. So we'll go open up the doc and then see if there's anything there. But what we're going to do next is I'm actually going to go and start calling people and looking them up to see who they are and then see what's up, see if we can close some business. So that would be the close of this first module, and then we'll get to actually looking at clients and calling them up.
