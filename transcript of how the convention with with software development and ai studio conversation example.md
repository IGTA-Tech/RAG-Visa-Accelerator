it's like i like it when i'm like really passionate about um something because i can get right into it that's how i got into sports visas so quickly it's just because i love fighting sports i love combat sports but this i think i'm starting to like better than even like the combat sports yeah i'm pretty definitely excited to be excited yeah yeah all right well did you have a conversation with uh we said michael Oh, Gabe, Gabe, Gabe. Right. Yeah. I mean, he's down, uh, whatever. Yeah. Whatever works. Um, yeah. It depends on what you have in mind. Uh, yeah, we can, we can take on projects you pass through. Uh, we can be a white label service, your extension, uh, development prototyping team, whatever you think works. Gotcha. Well, I've been fine tuning. the type of candidates that will go after. And I think it's something that could be mutually beneficial. I'm going to go after people that are already working, not students anymore. I think with the interns, I'll probably just take two. And I'm going to go after people that are already on H-B or looking to come in because for one, I don't have to build their profile. They're already there. They just need to have the agent-based petition and they need things to do. And they're going to be skilled enough that they're already useful. I've already started recruiting people that I think will be good at deploying. So, because I think that's going to be, everybody's going to start doing what I'm doing, which is kind of vibe coding, but then not know what to do about the nuances to bring it to life. So what I'm trying to do is, and I'm going to even like, it might go so far as I might even like create a nonprofit organization that's like the organization of deployment professionals, right? And all it's talking about is that people that go into vibe coding and bring it to a full project. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now there's a need for that right now for sure. Yeah. Yeah. And it's only going to grow. And like, you know, I think a lot of companies are going to use that too, even as contractors, things like that. Now this is where I think there's a synergy, right? Cause one thing they need is stuff to do on their itinerary and it doesn't have to actually happen. But so say like, uh, you know they're a petitioner with me and then i say okay part of the thing is we're going to open an llc with this this person and we're going to make that your consulting llc to do things so boom you have that and then we'll do it but also if we have like an interest or a deal memo with your company saying hey uh they're uh invited to work on projects like this is their rate that they'll do now they don't actually have to do it right but it just shows that they have stuff in their deal memo that they can and then you can lock in whatever price per hour or something like that and it could be it's not really important that it's anything as long as it's above minimum wage that's that's what they need because they can't tell you that you're supposed to have a certain amount of um um job salary On an O-one, on an H-one B you do, but an O-one, there is no minimum salary besides, you know, you can't just pay them under minimum salary, but also you don't have to give them any projects at all. They just have to be there and be available. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a good, good training system, right? They can just kind of like shadow work with our engineers and just like ask questions and understand how we do things. That way we're upscaling them too. Right. But the thing is like, you know, they might actually be really good and just already know and be actually helpful. Could you tell me more about O-one? I know H-one be O-one. Yes. So that's what I'm saying. These are not students. O-one is reserved for the best in the world in their endeavor. So you're talking about EB-A. So EB-A gets you a green card. O-one is the non-immigrant work visa version of EB-A. So they have the very same arguments, but O-one is looked at a little bit less scrutiny because it's not permanent. It lasts for three years. So that's what I'm saying. I can only really get this for people that really know what they're doing. Well, they might not be knowing what they do and what, you know, they might not have been in cursor and all that type of stuff, but there'll be people that are working already. And I'm trying to get the ones that are good at cursor and stuff like that. And like, you know, the other thing is like, when they come into the program, I'm gonna have them go through this guy named, you know, who Mark is. All right. Well, he's a, he's like a vibe coding guard, but I'm gonna have like a, I have a subscription to a school. Hmm. So part of what they'll get is like an opportunity to go through his school that teaches you about like the vibe coding apps, lovable, Tailwind, all that, and how to, you know, Vercel, Netlify, all that, how to bring it together. So my thing is, yes, they can learn and stuff like that, but I think I'm going to try to get them to like where they're actually, actually helpful, able to do stuff. Because I know that you're saying, because I know, And you're very adamant about doing your builds in three days, which means that you got to keep clients waiting while that's happening. No. Well, yeah, it doesn't have to be three days. Right. It depends on the complexity of the projects. If it's low complexity, we can get a prototype in three days and get the whole thing in seven days. We realize now that the urgency is actually not the biggest thing. Like clients are like, I don't give a fuck about like three days or seven days. Just give it to me like relatively quick. Right. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. So that's cool. And then I think another thing is. I mean, even if we're developing, we're still going to need, well, it depends on the strength of the people, the O-one trainee or developer. We can do, we can work in parallel, right? The cool thing is these are real life projects with real life constraints and real life data, right? So they can work on the project in parallel while my engineers work on the same project to actually build it to production. And that way they can like, Learn, yeah. Learn from each other. It's the same exact project, same assumptions, same structure, right? And then they can like check up on each other, right? Only as a way of learning. So that might be a thing, yeah. And then when they get good enough, yeah, like you said, when they get good enough, they can contribute and take a part of the project, right? Like an independent, insulated part of component of the project and work on it in parallel. Yeah. Slowly, slowly get them through. Yeah. So are you all your engineers use like those that are in the United States or do you use like foreign contractors? How do you find? We have two engineers in the US. We have three in Poland, but I work with the recruiting agency. I work with the recruiting agency who who who has a US base. Um, so they, so we're not working with freelancers, working with a us-based company that has, uh, full-time employees in, in, in, in Poland. Yeah. Oh, really? Is that Topsil is it? No, no, no. Yeah. I've been working with them for maybe like three, four years now. They're pretty good. Yeah. All right. Let me, um, all right. So. Cause I have two things. I have my own project that I need your help with, but, um, on this one, that's, that's kind of like what it is is we just need help with the, uh, having itinerary thing for them to do. And an oh one, they don't need job offers. They just need like basically interest memos saying like, Hey, yes, we have projects. And if you participate in projects like they are, then it's like, uh, this is like, you know, your rate or whatever, but they don't actually have to get one. Right. Yeah. Right, right, right, right, right, right, right. So, so what's the, so two questions. One is what is the, so they have, they're currently on a one visa. Um, you, you're saying that if they get additional work that builds their resume, they can, what, what, what's the goal for them? Okay. Yeah. So if it, so there's two things, we have people that are already eligible for a one, and then we have people that aren't already, if they're not already eligible, that's where we have the, like the, uh, the interns where they're working on stuff to get ready, whatever that means. So if we haven't filed, they'd be doing it just pro bono to learn the project and stuff like that. If it's one that's already on and they're filing, that's where they just need that interest letter that says, yeah, we're interested in potentially having you on a contract basis for a project basis when it comes up. And this is the rate. Now, that doesn't actually have to happen. So that's two things. One is people before they file, that's where they just learn. They don't need any rate. the interest letter when they're filing, especially saying like, hey, as part of the things they could possibly do on these O-one, this is one of those things. Does it matter the duration for which they're working on these projects, right? Like, I'm assuming you can't just be like, oh, they started last week, let's file it, right? Oh, so what I do is I put it that it starts from date of approval and then it extends the, the default is three years. So it's like there for a three year period to lock that, you know, doing this, but you know, if it needs to be shorter, but I always express my deal memos as deal date of approval and then going forward. So that way they can't be like, oh, well, they already started working before they had work authorization. No, it starts from the date of approval and goes from there. Gotcha. Gotcha. um yeah so cool so that makes sense i think we would have to think a little more about the structure of it because now we would add a almost an education and training arm to our company so there needs to be some reorganization the question is show road uh sherrod um what does the other side look like like will you be able to get us deals that we can pass on for these Right. Yeah. Let me, let me pull that up. Yeah. That was the second part of the business thing. All right. Let me share my screen. Here we go. All right. Let's see if he changed it yet. So you see how this, well, he's okay. He started doing it. Who we are business automation avatar suite. So he hasn't gotten to that part yet. All right. So. this home page is what i just had you know we're an automation studio right now if you look up here now these are new where i say we're switching more to a talent thing okay but then i'm going to have let's build and it's going to say we can do like this is going to say that you know we can do projects starting at four thousand And then we're going to change the front of this website to be like, we do talent and we just do four thousand and up builds. Right. And then as I'm bringing in people to have their own like projects or things they want to do, or even people that want to like invest in an AI business to come to the United States, that's where all that activity comes. So, for example, this venture gallery here, there's something called an E-two and L-one visa. Have you heard of those? All right. So those are like And E-two is like you invest in a business to come to United States. Oh, yes, yes. I have heard of that. Yeah, you're right. Now, the business doesn't have to be brick and mortar. And matter of fact, if it's not brick and mortar, it can cost a lot less. Like a million or something, minimum or something? No, that's the EB-five. EB-five investment fees, that's a million. The E-two doesn't have a set... It just has to make sense for whatever type of business you're doing. So if you're buying like a car dealership, then you might need millions of dollars to have the cars. But if you are opening a car wash, then maybe you just need sixty thousand to get like rent and stuff like that. Now, you might also need just seventy thousand if you're making an AI based business. Right. So as we're building stuff, we're putting them up here for licensable sale. So then if people like the concept, it's like, okay, cool. We can have that built for you. And we also have people that are ready to work. So that's when we pay you. Yes. I come back and say, yes, we have somebody that's licensed this. They're ready to move forward and we pay you. And then there is, man, I love it. I love it. Things are starting to click together. Yeah. There's so many like pieces of puzzle to this. I like it. I like it. Yeah. But I'm saying like, so the business part of bringing in a bit like, yes, we'll bring in business for a lot of ways. It even might be something like one of the people that have the L-One wants to start their own stuff, but they don't have they can't just do it themselves. They need somebody to help build it. So then it's like, OK, well, now you can come and, you know, get it from you, you know, put three thousand down and then build it with you. Then it helps them with their own itinerary. The other thing is before they have their visa, they can't really work on their own stuff. get paid anyway right it might make them make sense to just pay out right to you so they can get their business running file the visa now they can work for that right right right damn okay okay I love it, man. That's cool. That's cool. Where are you based? I'm in Charlotte, North Carolina. And this I had an office in Boynton Beach, Florida, that I'm reopening next week. So I'll be in between here and Boynton Beach, Florida, West Palm. Yeah, maybe I'll swing by and say hi sometimes. All right. Yeah, I'm pretty close. I'm in D.C. It's like a four or five hour drive or something. Yeah, I was just there for my birthday. Like I went to Hampton. So our arrival was Howard. So I used to spend a lot of time. And actually was a broker, a credit insurance broker for the export-import bank down there on K Street for a little bit. Yeah, my favorite place in D.C. to go is Stan's. It's amazing. Best chicken wings and mambo sauce. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I have to go. It's called Stan's? It's called Stan's. Stan's. S-T-A-N. Oh, it's Stan's, D.C. Western. Okay. I'll definitely check it out. It's a staple. And then if you order a drink, be careful because if you order like a Jack and Coke, they'll give you two glasses. And like the taller one is the liquor. And then the smaller one is your Coke. They don't play, huh? Nope. Nope. It's about two of those and you will miss the rest of the day for sure. All right, sir. Yes, sir. So the last thing, Brad, what you got? Next steps. Well, one thing. Before that, yeah, yeah, yeah. I forgot to tell you about the build. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Local host. This is locally deployed. I'm not all that good. I've been trying to deploy. That's the thing. I just need to get this deployed so my admin, who don't be doing what he's supposed to, has no excuse. All right? So typically... Like these petitions, when we do P ones and O one visas, EB one A's are like three hundred pages long and there's lots of nuance information and showing how that information is important. So what I did with this one is just like I was like, man, if you have a couple of links, you should be able to just have it build out. So. Let me see if this is still up here, so I can show you how it worked in the first place. It's here. OK, so I'll just I'll just go through one. It'll be quick. There's some, should I start here? Yeah, I'll start here. So he's a, this is actually a professional bull rider. He's getting a P one, a sick. Yeah. Yeah, man. I'm so sick of him taking so long. So I'm just gonna copy and paste some stuff, uh, that I have from him already. But the idea is like when this is fully built, if we have them in our intake system, And they, you know, they already just did their intake. It could just be push a button and then whatever they showed us in the first place, it just goes through the system automatically. So I'm not even like putting this in their career background. It's just taking them in from their intake information. Right, right, right. Right. So this one, I really liked the way this is done, how it just, watch this. So this is an argument I developed before because I'm like, hey, I did this on cloud. Why can't, you know, you just paste all these URLs, right? You say you can't? so he did something in eight, eight in and like, I'll show you. And it is not it, man. It's not, what do you like? And it is not, not, not it. Um, it's a, it's a no code tool, right? It doesn't, it doesn't do as much as what clock code can do for sure. Yeah. Uh, AI visa evaluation online. No, he called it. Okay. Innovative. Sorry. No problem. innovative visa evaluation okay there it is because we just had this link today so this is the one that i'm like making going to make available to the public right so like i'll just have like you know buy us some coffee but technically this is this is running kind of on the same engine but you see this is so annoying see this relevant link thing now you see how i just like pasted all those links and now they're here yeah i'm just like hey do that shit Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. He's like, I can't because it's going to mess with the front and back. And I'm like, clone the Git, put it in Clod, and tell it to do it. I don't think it can. So then I just like, while he's like bitching about it, I go on my phone and I just start taking screenshots. I'm like, hey, can Clod code do this? And it's like, absolutely. Absolutely. So I'm just like, yeah, stuff like that. So is he like expert in NAN or is he an actual coder or- No, he can code, but he prefers the type of thing. But he's going to have to get up out of that. He's very detailed, too. And he's really good with RAG. Because a lot of times, people that are good at coding aren't the best when it comes to getting the specific RAG just right. They're just not with that market. But I love this, how I just put in all those links, and here they are, right? Yeah, it looks good. Boom, next. So I could drop some files. So if I have PDFs, I put them in there, right? Say, make sure that the itinerary for the PBR league in the US is strong. Then I put an email, whatever. So this will go, and it takes about thirty minutes to do its thing. Now, let me see if I can find it. So I did that right, and it actually worked. I had problems getting it to work because it was timing out, because it's just so much stuff. and I couldn't deploy it. But then it finally went through right before we had this call. And so his first question was, well, how good was the quality of it? I'm like, that's a good question because I don't want to read it. But luckily for me, I made a custom GPT. That'll check it for me. Where's the conversation? Okay. First review. Hold on. I'm getting a little lag here. Can you still see it on the screen? Yeah, I can see your screen. Sherrod, I mean, there's, like, there's, like, companies, startups focused on doing this. Oh, I know, but I don't want to sell, like, the main part of it is to use internally for me. Oh, no, no. What I'm saying is I think you're doing a great job. There's, like, whole companies with whole teams trying to build something like that. Oh, yeah. And I think you're doing great. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, man. They suck. Let's get it. Look, I got a high likelihood. This is a very stringent strategy. This thing is supposed to scream at me. You know what I mean? Be like, no, this sucks. This one sucks. This thing, in this case, is strong. Real strong because it's so nightly put together. Now, let's get into what I want to actually build. How do I want to actually do this? Here's the bearing scheme. Here's the grand scheme. Look at this. This is... As we're recruiting candidates, they're coming in here, and we just put a couple links. It gets their GitHub, their research stuff, and stuff like that. Now, imagine, and we do it like this. Where is it? Something's missing. Hold on. That's not right. I think somebody might have messed with my script. You use Google Apps Scripts? Yeah, Google Apps Scripts, yep. It's working offline. Why would this be working offline when I'm online? That's weird. Anyway, we can do without that. Basically, there's a button here that just says, as we get a candidate, you just text their information in there. But what I want to build, is a system that builds the visa processes automatically so for one is there'll be a portal and like every candidate that's in here has like an id that's matched with their name so imagine we just have like a one portal that no matter what document it comes in it automatically populates whatever category that they're feeling for that specific person and then it's like what we want to we run an automation that basically does what I just did, but it just does it based on the sheet as a web book instead of the manual input. And that's what feeds them the information that says, hey, you're this close, this close or that close. Right. But, you know, obviously I just, you know, kind of built this thing today, but I want to really get it succinct enough for one internally we can do it, but then also so that we can sell this. yeah yeah so let me yeah we can sell it directly to you know they can skip law firms they can just pay this thing like four five hundred dollars have that spit out and then be on their way that's what's up man uh democratize right uh this stuff um so let me get this straight so you basically the end product you want is uh kind of a front end where they can upload There is their form with structured texts of what they enter information and then like uploads of specific documents. And then you say that documents gets automatically categorized or you have to, it gets automatically categorized. Right. So I have this working on the flow, but this is, this is my best case scenario. The best case scenario that there's a front end. And, um, they put their name and then hope, like, then I'll show like, okay, confirm this as you. And then, so then it confirmed that's the right person. Then it's just like, just enter documents. And so they enter documents and yes, that information goes automatically to where it's supposed to go within our backend. Right. You know, I prefer it be Google sheets and Google drive stuff. Cause I just like that, but I mean, I can use super base and air table, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever works. And then once they do that, it says, okay, confirm documents are in there. Would you like to check your evaluation? Now they can press that. And if it comes in higher than seventy percent, they'll send us the links. It's like, okay, it's been alerted that you are close to being finished. Somebody will review it and let you know if we're ready to actually produce the petition. How is that different from what you currently have now from the thing that you built? Because you're also just inputting information and inputting the files. Well, This is just kind of like the first iteration of nuance I want to have about it. With help, I can get this much, much better. You know what I mean? With help, I get it much better. And then I could also make it so it's scalable to use like, you know, for other people. Rather it be like an API key to go through it for other people like to use the tool or just make it as a product like itself. But the thing is, I know my limitations and I know how quickly I need this for my actual business to work. So I just need some help. So two things you're saying, right? The front end, the MVP that you showed me earlier works perfectly fine as an MVP to showcase the, it's like a proof of concept that it works, right? And then there's two things you want to do. One is you want it to work internally via a sheet like this. um so that you can input uh your candidate or your client information oh no so they can do it themselves so it's just like yeah we can send them a link and they just go and input their information And then we have a system that'll look through their information and then weekly send them like, hey, this would make your petition more strong. You just need to input it when you get it. I see, I see. OK, so basically, yeah, you want its own system that allows the users to have its own account. So it's like a multi-tenant system. Each user have their own account. It's safe. It's good privacy, good back end database. The users input their files and their information and tells them their progress or their strength, application strength, and then gives them reminders on what can improve the strength. I think Gabe is here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so, yeah. Hello, Gabe. Hi, I know somebody doing a show. I joined in earlier, but I didn't see you guys. Oh, it was a different link. Like, I had updated the link. Oh, okay. I'm not sending it. But Gabe, I want to introduce you to Sherrod. Absolute genius. Good man. Really good taste on fried chicken also. And he's doing a lot of engineering himself. Like Claude, he's building some cool shit. And basically, I'm just going to do a quick rundown, Sherrod. One thing that we talked about is potential partnership where he can get potential O-one candidates who needs to strengthen their resume to get the visa applications right. They can work under us as some sort of like training arm, training arm. they can build in parallel to the projects we get right um to train them um and then on the other end uh shara can bring us clients who has build needs um and then some other crazy stuff about like buying uh investment on different uh software companies and buildings and stuff uh and on top of that he has his own project that he's built an mvp for that's actually pretty cool uh that he wants us to build it more robustly and into production Is that is that right? Some good summary. Yeah, that's a good summary. I can tie up some of like the loose ends quickly. So the old one visa is like the Einstein visa, but it's not permanent residence is for a work visa for three years. And there's two phases of which we have people. We have people that are needing to build their profile, which means they're available for pro bono work just to build stuff on their resume so they can be eligible. And then we have people that are eligible that need projects for their itinerary. Now, those projects don't have to be job offers. This is usually like ideally how it would work. We serve as their agent petitioner, which means like we're the ones on the paperwork for their visa. And then we'll set up an LLC for them to do like their own bill that they're doing. But it also helps them to have a deal memo from a third party that gives them like. the hope of maybe not even that they have to get the contract work, but they can. So saying like, and there's no, it can be as long as it's more than minimum wage is fine. So it's like, okay, if they have a deal memo from your company saying like, hey, we recognize your skills in deployment or whatever it is, we want to have you available for contract work for this rate, if needs like come up from this time to this time. So that's the structure on the talent side of like, kind of like, all we need that'd be like helpful for us for one having people work on projects parallel for free while they're trying to build their resume and then two having them like the the opportunity of potential contract work you know if it comes up they don't actually have to get it but it's good that we have those type of deal memos in place it's like say if you was like an actress and you don't know if you're going to get the movie role but you want to have that movie role in your itinerary just in case you can get it so they can't say you're coming for the united states for nothing all right Then the second thing was, yeah, we do, oh, let me show you the other thing that he's, yeah. So this is our website and we're making upgrades to it as we speak to be doing two things. One is we're mostly doing talent for employers and like, you know, people in the AI space, specifically people that are good at deploying after vibe coding. And then we're saying we can do builds. So like we might say we do builds starting at four thousand dollars now there's a couple ways that the business will that for this will come one is from people that are looking to invest in businesses to come to the United States, it costs a lot less for them to do a business that is not brick and mortar. So we can sell them a license to some of the concepts that we're coming up with and be like, hey, you can license this for eighty thousand dollars. We can get it built for you. And we also have employees that can keep up with going. Another way it might be going is if somebody is in the program and they actually need to start a company, but they can't work on it. So then they need to pay someone to have them actually build it because they can't really do it themselves and sell it, right? So that's the other way that stuff comes in, you know, just because I'm pretty good. If I have time, I create opportunities. So there'll be people asking me to build stuff and I'll be like, okay, sure, we're doing it. It's really like you guys. I love this, like George. Um, I mean, like you're creating so many opportunities for so many people at the same time, while also like making something that could be really profitable. Like it's all good all around. I love it. Yeah. And then the fight, I appreciate that. Cause I was telling him, I got on the call and I'm like, kind of jittery. I'm like going like this. I'm like, man, I just have my biggest floating breakthrough. Like ever, because like my admin that actually doing the visas, he's like going so slow. And I'm like, this is not going to work because I'm getting ready to like to go crazy. And so I was like, I bet I can do this. I can figure this out and have this done on my own. So I did. So this is my visa petition generator, just like kind of crude. And, you know, an old one package might have three hundred, four hundred pages of real evidence that's put together in a certain type of way that I like it. So it took me all damn day. Actually, it took me three days. But I got it done to where I can go through this, you know, just put it in like ten links. And it research to where it came out with, you know, all like, so these aren't even PDFs. These are just a link analysis. And just to make sure that my output worked before it comes to this, I put it through my custom GPT that I already checked my actual petitions with. High approval. High approval. So what I'm looking to build. You know, like I need you guys to help give me a good price is, uh, cause I need this going because I'm getting ready to recruit the best in the world. People that are in trouble with H one Bs, uh, that are not gonna be able to come in because of the new a hundred thousand dollar consulate rule. And just because people are gonna get start getting, um, uh, laid off on H one Bs. So we're looking to switch them to oh ones, but I'm already recruiting them. So what I'm looking to do is as I'm recruiting people to whatever database that we're using. uh one i get my tool to be much better with the nuances i want to put in there but it automa it automates one giving them feedback on the quality of their documents and what's needed to make it better and then having it so that it automatically pushes this out once we approve that they're at a certain rate so we're looking at one making a front end that these folks Just put in like, no, put in their name. It verifies that as them, they put in documents and then that those documents automatically go to where they're supposed to go in the backend. And then, um, no, we need that stuff later. That's just the basics of it. Cause I already recorded the rest so I can send a follow up, but I'm just, I'm really happy about that. And I also think that it's going to get to a point where people can just use the tool on their own to do their own visa or just take their links, put it in there and tell you what's missing. And then another pay a couple hundred bucks and they're ready to go, but hopefully not before I make my money first. Uh, I mean, if you, if you don't make money, you cannot keep helping them out. Right. So it makes sense. So, Sherrod, I would be down for us to help you work on that product. It sounds like you have the MVP ready. I don't think it will take too much to productionize it and get it scalable. and then the partnership stuff we could keep talking like we're both very interested uh um so how would you like to do this um we can so but both gabe and i are out uh starting friday for a week okay right i don't know what's the urgency it is for for this thing that you want to develop i think that i you know i need a week to really like plan it like i can you know i can get stuff like set up step by step with all the mvps that i like I wanted it. So like for me, it's more about it being done correctly. And besides that, like I really just started the recruiting process. I just hired, you guys heard of Mega AI? Well, they do like, they do meta ads. But basically I'm just now gonna start advertising for this now. So I'm fine. I'm gonna go close a couple of clients and stuff like that, the business end. They're not expecting for their visa to be done tomorrow. Well, there's one person that is, but. just run it through what i have um but um yeah so for me i could take the week and really just like plan it out um so that it's just about you know kind of like putting it together seeming it up and then um you know i'll be like recruiting so like you know in a week's time hopefully i'll have some people that are interested in internship not too many but more people that are like okay i'm ready to like go on the other one side and go from there Makes sense. Yeah. Um, what do you, how do you think can help before we leave in two days and maybe we'll schedule a time to meet up, uh, after. Okay. All right. So like by, uh, Friday, um, it's okay on friday i'll definitely be further along and i'll probably have a visual representation of how it could go so if i can get feedback on like kind of what's possible what's not what type of tools we can use and what's not and also i know that you guys have your custom things that you build so i have a mutual nda that i have so like you know you just like be protect on that because i'm very you know I just, I'm a lawyer, you know, so I can, um, I can send you that. So that way we can actually get into like the nitty gritty and stuff like that. And then really think about, uh, the structure of like how the talent side, how it could help you guys. And then we could, uh, so that way I know, and I can build off of that because that's a, that's a feather I can put in my cap saying that, uh, yeah, we can have a separate deal memo in place, um, You know what else? Can I just introduce one more idea? Yes, sir. Okay. So one of the categories of what's helpful for these petitions is something called memberships. What I want to do is go to the vibe coding and deploying companies and say like, hey, I want to co-build a certification program that helps identify who's in the membership of the top one percent users in the world. Now, I don't need them to actually give me that much information. So if I come to them, it's pretty much already done. They just need to give me some feedback on what would make the test accurate, and they sign off on it. That is something that's on my mind, because then you can have certification programs that you also make as one, as a part of participating in the program, but two, available on its own app. Like imagine you're just sitting on the train. It's like, man, I really need to switch my visa type. Well, let me get on the certification test and just start scoring him and ranking myself and getting up. So then when they go to do their petition, they can say, yes, I'm one of the top one percenters in lovable. the world and then put that under visa petition and then lovable would probably like it because then there's people that know how to use their product that are going out into the workforce so are you creating are you is there existing for certain certain set of initial categories we might work with are there existing certification programs or are you thinking about so so that if that if that's so then we'll just be like a conduit like a marketplace or like the connecting the certificate programs with the users? Or are you talking about you want to create your own certificate Create my own that's really branded as them because it's just not like, hey, I'm certified. It's like, no, I'm recognized as one of the top users in the world at this percentage because just having a certificate might not be as persuasive for membership because they don't know what the criteria is. But if it's introduced as a ranking, there's a lot of stuff immigration wise that you can do with that. How would one verify the reputation of the certification establishment? Number two is if you want a good ranking in a population, you need a large sample size that is representative of a population, right? So I think these are the two main kind of like questions and challenges I see in my brain. You know what I'm saying? Like if you want to say, oh, this guy ranks at top one percent, it doesn't really mean much if there's only like fifty people that's participated. Right. So then for it to actually mean something, you would already have had multiple hundred people in the program or something like that. Right. So that's one of the things I need help with is kind of think about how to make that work. Now, I imagine that all of these companies know, you know, the best questions and problems that users are doing because they're seeing all these use cases. So it's almost like, hey, you don't have to tell us how many people are using your stuff, but if you come with the most complicated problems that you have seen and there's like five of those and then like you're certifying and then maybe i go or like it all of them like you all collectively are in this association that agrees that the certification process in this as a conglomerate works remember i talked about the non-profit of the the professional deployers association And like what that does is like, OK, this is certified by this association that has the participation of these companies that all agree that this is the industry standard when it comes to creating the certification test. I think that's what it is. I need to make it a nonprofit. No, you're right. You're right. Yeah, I think I need to make it a nonprofit and then they can get tax tax tax deductions. Yeah. And also, it's kind of like a hackathon almost, like a virtual mini hackathon. And hackathons benefit a lot of parties because the tools they built, you get a certain percentage of it. And you get to find the smartest people immediately. right and then and then you get to find creative solutions to a certain problem right it might not even be a problem that they've solved before they're like this is some some complicated yeah yeah and see what creative stuff so yes that's like it can be like a certification too but it also would be like a battleground too but it's like oh i want to battle somebody in solving this problem in ten minutes using lovable yeah and that way they can donate credits and stuff like that too and i don't have to pay for those That's true, that's true. Okay, cool, cool, cool. All right, so next- You want co-ownership in this one? You guys need some tax deductions too? Let's go, let's go. Yeah, yeah. So mutual NDA signing, talent work, business structure, deal memo. thinking that through uh and then you're gonna send us some sort of architect and plan for your product by friday for us to like look through and give some thoughts right yes that's correct okay sounds good uh i'm excited i'm gonna send this list to you sherrod um so we have it somewhere um and uh and uh yeah let's schedule a meeting before when we come back yeah All right, sounds good. Friday is good. Afternoon, like early afternoon is preferred. In two weeks, it's going to be like Thanksgiving week. I don't know if you want to do that week or the week after. I thought you said about in two days. Oh, oh, sure. Two days. Sure. Yeah. I think we should have some time in the afternoon. Yeah. Yes. I thought the plan was we'll meet in two days. I was gonna show you some guy stuff. And then when you guys come back, we'll be really, really ready to go. Okay, all right, let's do it. Um, two days. So earlier, the better for us, because we're literally going to be in the retreat center by like, all right. How about today? Perfect. Yeah. Um, and we're going to be in Arizona to our difference, I think. All right. I'll put something on schedule for us. Okay. Yes, sir. For for like noon, your time. Is that okay? That's perfect. All right. Yes, sir. Be sure to get some pamphlets on breathing exercises. You see, I get excited, man. I get excited. Now we can do a little meditation thing together next time we meet. I'm down.
